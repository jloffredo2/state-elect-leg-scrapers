FISCAL IMPACT: The Department of State states this bill, <u class="amendmentInsertedText">as introduced</u> , may increase state general fund expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2015 and FY 2017. There will be no impact on county and local expenditures, or state, county, and local revenue. METHODOLOGY: The Department of State states this bill will ease the requirements to obtain general election ballot access for third party and independent candidates. Beginning in 2014, many independent or third party candidates will be able to qualify for the general election ballot by paying the same fee as party candidates filing for a primary election. In addition, the bill will make it easier for political organizations to obtain party status, potentially requiring additional voting columns on the general election ballot beginning in 2016. The Department states that these changes may result in more candidates appearing in the &#8220;other&#8221; column on the general election ballot, resulting in additional paper and printing costs. The Department states that, although it is unable to accurately estimate the additional costs resulting from the bill, paper and printing costs for the 2012 general election totaled $185,000. The Department assumes that costs for the 2014 election (which would be incurred in FY 2015) may increase by 20 percent, or $37,000. The Department further states it is not unreasonable to expect that two additional parties would qualify for the general election ballot in 2016 and each election year thereafter, which would have the effect of adding an additional page to the ballot and potentially doubling the current cost of $185,000 per election year. These costs would be incurred beginning in FY 2017, and would recur every two years.
