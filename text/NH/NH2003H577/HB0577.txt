The system shall facilitate the identification and correction of voter registration records whenever a registered voter has died or has been disenfranchised pursuant to part I, article 11 of the New Hampshire constitution or RSA 654:5 through RSA 654:6, or when the domicile address does not match the address provided by the same individual to the department of safety.

Access by local election officials shall be subject to the limitations of paragraph VI, and shall be limited to the records of individuals who are currently registered to vote in the official's jurisdiction and individuals who are applying to register to vote in the official's jurisdiction. V. The secretary of state shall: (a) Specify the employees of the department of state authorized to access records contained in the voter database, subject to the limitations of paragraph VI. (b) Provide adequate technological security measures to deter unauthorized access to the records contained in the voter database. (c) Issue guidelines to implement the voter database. VI.
