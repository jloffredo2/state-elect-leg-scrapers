Be it Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring, that the Constitution of New Hampshire be amended as follows: I. That article 11 of the first part of the constitution be amended to read as follows: [Art.] 11. [Elections and Elective Franchises.] All elections are to be free, and every inhabitant of the state of 18 years of age and upwards shall have an equal right to vote in any election. A person who is 17 years of age may vote in a primary election preceding a general election at which such person will be 18 years of age. Every person shall be considered an inhabitant for the purposes of voting in the town, ward, or unincorporated place where he or she has his or her domicile. No person shall have the right to vote under the constitution of this state who has been convicted of treason, bribery, or any willful violation of the election laws of this state or of the United States; but the supreme court may, on notice to the attorney general, restore the privilege to vote to any person who may have forfeited it by conviction of such offenses. The general court shall provide by law for voting by qualified voters who at the time of the biennial or state elections, or of the primary elections therefor, or of city elections, or of town elections by official ballot, are absent from the city or town of which they are inhabitants, or who by reason of physical disability are unable to vote in person, in the choice of any officer or officers to be elected or upon any question submitted at such election. Voting registration and polling places shall be easily accessible to all persons including disabled and elderly persons who are otherwise qualified to vote in the choice of any officer or officers to be elected or upon any question submitted at such election. The right to vote shall not be denied to any person because of the nonpayment of any tax. Every inhabitant of the state, having the proper qualifications, has equal right to be elected into office. II. That the above amendment proposed to the constitution be submitted to the qualified voters of the state at the state general election to be held in November, 2014. III. That the selectmen of all towns, cities, wards and places in the state are directed to insert in their warrants for the said 2014 election an article to the following effect: To decide whether the amendments of the constitution proposed by the 2014 session of the general court shall be approved.
