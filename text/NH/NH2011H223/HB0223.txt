LBAO 11-0714 Revised 03/16/11 HB 223 FISCAL NOTE AN ACT eliminating election day voter registration. FISCAL IMPACT: The Department of State, Department of Justice, Department of Safety, New Hampshire Municipal Association, and Department of Health and Human Services state this bill will increase state general fund, state highway fund, and local expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2012 and each year thereafter. There will be no fiscal impact on county expenditures, or state, county, and local revenues. METHODOLOGY: The Department of State states this bill eliminates election day voter registration. The Department also states under this bill New Hampshire would no longer be exempt from the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and therefore the Department of Safety, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Education would necessarily become voter registration agencies. The Department anticipates it will need to provide training to these agencies, town officials, and the general public, requiring a training coordinator, three program assistants, and a secretary. Additionally, the Department estimates it will require a supervisor to oversee management of the NVRA requirements and a systems development specialist to address related information technology needs. Under this bill, the Secretary of State will print and make available provisional ballots for voters who did not register 30 days prior to the election and one part-time position will be required to process those provisional ballots. Finally, the Department would print and mail forms, informational brochures, and training manuals to reach voters. The Department estimates these costs as follows: &#160; FY 2012 FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 Training Coordinator Salary (LG 21) 37,489 39,390 41,087 42,744 Training Coordinator Benefits 23,149 25,132 27,263 29,577 Program Assistant x 3 (LG 15) Salary + Benefits 153,947 163,333 173,204 183,854 Secretary Salary (LG 9) 23,712 24,628 25,584 27,514 Secretary Benefits 20,399 22,192 24,177 26,545 Supervisor Salary (LG 27) 48,770 50,915 53,138 55,497 Supervisor Benefits 25,400 27,426 29,663 32,116 Systems Development Specialist Salary (LG 23) 41,086 42,842 44,752 46,722 Systems Development Specialist Benefits <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 23,867 </u> <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 25,819 </u> <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 27,993 </u> <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 30,369 </u> Salary and Benefits Subtotal 397,819 421,677 446,861 474,938 Current Expenses (fuel, equipment maintenance) 6,000 9,000 9,000 9,000 Equipment (two vehicles @ $13,335, office furniture and office equipment) 56,670 0 0 0 Office Space (750 sq ft @ $18) 13,500 13,500 13,500 13,500 In-State Travel 4,000 4,000 4,000 4,000 Printing and Postage 200,000 200,000 200,000 200,000 Provisional Ballots (200,000 @ $0.50 each) 100,000 200,000 0 200,000 Software Upgrades and Maintenance 1,000,000 180,000 180,000 180,000 Part-time Provisional Ballot Processing ($30 per hour @ 80 hours per election) 24,000 48,000 0 48,000 Total 1,801,989 1,076,177 853,361 1,129,438 The Department of Justice estimates this bill would require 20 percent of the time of one Assistant Attorney General in litigation following passage of the bill for approximately one year at a cost of $19,580 in FY 2012 ($66,950 full-time attorney salary + $30,952 benefits = $97,902 * 20 percent). The Department of Safety states this bill would require the Division of Motor Vehicles to have a significant role in voter registration to comply with NVRA, which requires states to provide individuals with the opportunity to register to vote at the same time they apply for or renew a driver&#8217;s license. The Department would be responsible for providing information on the voter-registration application process; creating, distributing, and processing voter-registration application forms; accepting and transmitting completed voter-registration applications to the appropriate election official within a prescribed timeframe. The Department estimates implementation of this bill will require a consultant for programming, new forms, postage and transmittal, and two full-time and one half-time counter clerks (at labor grade 9) to process the voter registration forms. The Department estimates these costs as follows: &#160; FY 2012 FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 Counter Clerk (Labor Grade 9) 23,712 24,629 25,584 26,540 Social Security (6.2%) 1,470 1,527 1,586 1,706 Medicare (1.45%) 344 357 371 399 Retirement (12.31%) 2,919 3,019 3,137 3,373 Life Insurance 20 20 20 20 Dental 937 984 1,033 1,085 Health <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 14,709 </u> <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 16,285 </u> <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 18,030 </u> <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 19,962 </u> Subtotal Full-Time Salary and Benefits 44,111 46,821 49,761 53,085 Clerk Subtotal (x Two FTE) 88,222 93,642 99,522 106,170 Part-time Clerk (at 50%) 11,856 12,314 12,792 13,757 Part-time Clerk Benefits (at 7.65%) <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 907 </u> <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 942 </u> <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 979 </u> <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 1,052 </u> Salary and Benefits Total 100,985 106,898 113,292 120,979 Consultant Programming Costs (750 hours at $150/hour) 112,500 0 0 0 Form Changes 10,000 0 0 0 Information Transmission 50,000 50,000 50,000 50,000 Total $273,485 $156,898 $163,292 $170,979 The New Hampshire Municipal Association states under this bill municipal welfare offices would be required to provide voter registration services and municipalities would be required to process provisional ballots which continue to come in after the election. While this bill would eliminate the need to have election officials available to assist with registration at the polls on election day, the Association states this bill will result in a net increase in local expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2012 and each year thereafter. However, because the Association cannot predict the cost to provide voter registration services, the exact fiscal impact cannot determined at this time. The Department of Health and Human Services states under this bill all offices offering public assistance would be required to provide voter registration services. The Department states this bill will increase state expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2012 and each year thereafter. The Department anticipates the impact of adding non-benefit related responsibilities would be significant; however, because the Department cannot predict the cost to provide voter registration services, the exact fiscal impact cannot determined at this time. The Department of Education states this bill will have no fiscal impact on state or local funds in FY 2012 and each year thereafter.
