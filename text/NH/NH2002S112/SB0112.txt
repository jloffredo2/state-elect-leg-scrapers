Be it Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened: 1 Voters and Checklists; Registering at Polling Place, Same Day Registration; Affidavit. RSA&#160;654:7-a, II is repealed and reenacted to read as follows: II. Any person whose name is not on the checklist but who is otherwise a qualified voter shall be entitled to vote by requesting to be registered to vote at the polling place on election day. The voter may then vote at that election. The applicant may be required to produce appropriate proof of qualifications as provided in RSA 654:12. The applicant shall complete an election day affidavit which shall be prescribed by the secretary of state, and which, at the discretion of the supervisors of the checklist, shall contain either of the following written oaths or affirmations: (a) I do hereby certify under penalty of perjury that to the best of my knowledge, I am a qualified voter, and that I am not disqualified on any ground from voting, and I have not voted and will not vote at any other polling place this election. _________________________________ (Signature of Applicant) (b) My name is ____________. I am today registering to vote in the city (town) of __________, New Hampshire. I understand that to vote in this city (town), I must be at least 18 years of age, I must be a United States citizen, and I must be a resident of this city (town). A resident is a person who is not just living in a city (town) temporarily, but one who intends to make the city (town) his or her permanent domicile. This domicile is the voter's residence to which, upon temporary absence, he or she has the intention of returning. This domicile is that place, in which he or she dwells on a continuing basis for a significant portion of each year. I understand that a person can be a resident of only one state and one city (town) at a time. By voting today, I am acknowledging that I am not a resident of any other state or any other city (town). I understand that if I am a resident of another state or city (town), I may be entitled to vote in elections held within that state or city (town) by absentee ballot. In declaring myself a resident of New Hampshire, I am subject to the laws of the State of New&#160;Hampshire which apply to all residents, including laws requiring me to register my motor vehicles and apply for a New Hampshire driver's license within 60 days of becoming a resident. In declaring myself a New Hampshire resident, I realize that I may be forfeiting benefits or rights, including the right to vote, in another state. If I have any questions as to whether I am entitled to vote in this city (town), I am aware that a supervisor of the checklist is available to address my questions or concerns. I acknowledge that I have read and understand the above qualifications for voting and do hereby swear, under penalty of perjury, that I am qualified to vote in the above-stated city (town) on this day, and I have not voted and will not vote at any other polling place this election. _________________ _____________________________ Date Signature 2 Effective Date. This act shall take effect 60 days after its passage.
