This act shall take effect 60 days after its passage. LBAO 05-0506 Revised 2/22/05 HB 639 FISCAL NOTE AN ACT relative to voter registration. FISCAL IMPACT: The Departments of State, Health and Human Services, Education, and Safety state this bill will increase state and local expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2006 and each year thereafter. There will be no fiscal impact on state, county, and local revenue or county expenditures. METHODOLOGY: The Department of State states the Department would be required to hire one Training Coordinator at labor grade 21, three Program Assistant II positions at labor grade 15, and one Secretary position at labor grade 9. The Training Coordinator would organize and run the overall training required to comply with the National Voter Rights Act (NVRA), and the Program Assistants would be assigned to the additional state agencies charged with registration of voters (Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, and Department of Safety). In addition to the rental of office space and the purchase of furniture and office equipment, two vehicles would have to be purchased for conducting extensive training outside of Concord. Printing costs would increase to provide for educational materials and forms required by the NVRA. Assuming annual step increases, and benefits at 44% of salary, the estimated fiscal impact on state general fund expenditures is as follows: <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 </u> <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> First Year Start-Up Costs </u> Office Furniture $ 13,000 Office Equipment 15,000 Two Vehicles <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 21,578</u> Total $ 49,578 Secretary 30,011 $ 31,210 $ 32,468 $ 33,726 3 Program Assistants 113,937 118,878 123,822 129,033 Training Coordinator 48,732 50,769 53,015 55,231 Office Rent 12,000 12,000 12,000 12,000 Fuel/Vehicle Maintenance 4,000 4,000 4,000 4,000 Education Materials<u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 200,000 200,000 200,000 200,000</u> Fiscal Year Total $458,258 $416,857 $425,305 $433,990 The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) states the Department of State will provide all materials and forms to be used, and training on implementation of the bill. Primary anticipated costs to DHHS would include staff time to attend training, costs for mailing completed forms to appropriate supervisors of the checklist, and additional time spent with each applicant to distribute voter registration applications and assist in completion of forms. The Department is unable to determine the exact fiscal impact at this time, since the scope and amount of time for training, and the number of registrations to be processed is unknown. The Department of Education states the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) indicates that public schools are among the state and local agencies that shall be designated which may require additional staff. The Department does provide services to the disabled through the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation service delivery and customer service and its seven regional offices. In order to maintain the current caseloads and process voter registration applications, it is likely the Department will require additional staff in some of the regional offices. The Department is moving towards an electronic on-line teacher certification system, which would make including voter registration material with recertification difficult unless the information supplied by the Department of State could also be provided in an electronic format. Given the fact that various state and local governmental agencies will be processing voter registration applications and sending the applications to local town and city officials, it is likely that municipal governments will require additional staff to verify and process voter information. The exact fiscal impact cannot be determined at this time. The Department of Safety states this bill will require the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to attach a voter registration form to each driver license application and modify its change of address form to provide for a qualified elector to state that the form is not for voter registration purposes. The DMV estimates that it will be necessary to hire five Clerk I positions at labor grade 2, replace its current stock of application and change of address forms, and increase postage expenditures. The Department assumes this bill would become effective in FY 2006. The estimated fiscal impact on state highway fund expenditures is as follows: <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 </u> 5 Clerk I Positions $ 77,905 $ 80,145 $ 82,585 $ 85,120 Benefits @ 44% 34,278 35,264 36,337 37,453 Application Forms (618 Pads @ $2.71) 1,675 0 0 0 Address Change Forms (425 packs @ $2.96) 1,258 0 0 0 Additional Postage<u class="amendmentInsertedText"> 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000</u> Fiscal Year Total $116,116 $116,409 $119,922 $123,573
