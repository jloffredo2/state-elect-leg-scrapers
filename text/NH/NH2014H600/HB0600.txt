Be it Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened: 1 Eligibility; Voter; Domicile. Amend RSA 654:1, I to read as follows: I. Every inhabitant of the state, having a single established domicile for voting purposes, being a citizen of the United States, of the age provided for in Article 11 of Part First of the Constitution of New Hampshire, shall have a right at any meeting or election, to vote in the town, ward, or unincorporated place in which he or she is domiciled. An inhabitant&#8217;s domicile for voting purposes is that one place where a person, more than any other place, has established a physical presence and manifests an intent to maintain a single continuous presence for domestic, social, and civil purposes relevant to participating in democratic self-government. A person has the right to change domicile at any time, however a mere intention to change domicile in the future does not, of itself, terminate an established domicile before the person actually moves. A person&#8217;s claim of domicile for voting purposes shall not be conclusive of the person&#8217;s residence for any other legal purpose. 2 Voter Registration.

Amend RSA 654:12, V(a)-(b) to read as follows: V.(a) The election official approving the application for registration as voter of a person who does not present an approved form of photo identification as proof of identity when registering, shall mark the voter registration form to indicate that no photo identification was presented and shall inform the person that, if he or she is a first-time election day registrant in New Hampshire, he or she will receive a letter of identity verification. The person entering the voter information into the centralized voter registration database shall determine if the person is listed in the system as having been previously registered in the town or ward reported by the applicant on the voter registration form. If the person is a new registrant who has not been previously registered anywhere in New Hampshire or if the centralized voter registration database does not confirm a previous registration claimed on the voter registration form, the election official shall cause the record created in the centralized voter registration database to indicate that the person is a new applicant in New Hampshire and that no photo identification was presented. When municipalities enter information on people who register on election day into the centralized voter registration database, to the extent practical applicants who are registering for the first time in New Hampshire and who also register without presenting an approved photo identification shall be entered first. <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">The person entering the voter information of election day residents into the centralized voter registration database shall cause the records to indicate if the voter executed a domicile affidavit.</strike> (b) The secretary of state shall cause a letter of identity verification to be mailed by first class mail to each voter identified at <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">any</strike> a state general election as a first-time election day registrant in New Hampshire who also did not verify his or her identity with an approved photo identification.

The secretary of state shall mark the envelope with instructions to the United States Post Office not to forward the letter and to provide address correction information.

To prove the qualifications set forth in paragraphs I and II, an applicant for registration as a voter must prove his or her identity to establish that the evidence used to prove age, citizenship, and domicile relate to the applicant. A person who has in his or her immediate possession a photo identification approved for use by paragraph II must present that identification when applying for registration. A person who does not have an approved photo identification with him or her may establish identity through any reasonable means, including, but not limited to: photo identification not approved by paragraph II, but determined to be legitimate by the supervisors of the checklist or clerk, verification of the person&#8217;s identity by another person registered as a voter and known to the supervisor or clerk, or completion of the qualified voter affidavit, which shall be retained in accordance with RSA 33-A:3-a. Residents of a nursing home or similar facility may prove their identity through verification of identity by the administrator of the facility or by his or her designee. For the purposes of this section, the application of a person whose identity has been verified by an official of a nursing home or similar facility shall be treated in the same manner as the application of a person who proved his or her identity with a photo identification. 8 Effective Date. This act shall take effect 60 days after its passage. LBAO 13-0773 Revised 02/04/13 HB 600 FISCAL NOTE AN ACT relative to voter registration. FISCAL IMPACT: The Department of State states this bill, <u class="amendmentInsertedText">as introduced</u> , may decrease state expenditures by $3,600 in FY 2013, $7,200 in FY 2014, $36,000 in FY 2015, $21,600 in FY 2016, and $36,000 in FY 2017. The Judicial Branch and New Hampshire Association of Counties state the fiscal impact of this bill on state and county revenue and expenditures is indeterminable. There will be no impact on local revenue or expenditures. METHODOLOGY: The Department of State (DOS) reports this bill modifies forms and procedures for voter registration and also provides that a person&#8217;s claim of domicile for voting purposes shall not be conclusive of the person&#8217;s residence for any other legal purpose. DOS states this bill would eliminate the current verification mailings for domicile affidavits which do not require an affirmative response from the voter. DOS reports each verification mailing costs approximately $2.00 and during the 2012 general election approximately 1.8 percent of voters filled out a domicile affidavit to register to vote. DOS assumes elections in future years will have the same domicile affidavit rate (1.8% of voters) and the same mailing cost per item ($2.00). DOS calculates the following decreases in expenditures based on the election schedule and its assumptions noted above. Election Type FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 FY 2016 FY 2017 # Town Voters 100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000 # City Voters -- 100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000 # Primary Voters -- -- 200,000 -- 200,000 # General Voters -- -- 600,000 -- 600,000 # Presidential Primary Voters -- -- -- 400,000 -- # Total Voters 100,000 200,000 1,000,000 600,000 1,000,000 Affidavit Rate x 1.8% x 1.8% x 1.8% x 1.8% x 1.8% Estimated Voters 1,800 3,600 18,000 10,800 18,000 Cost per mailing x $2.00 x $2.00 x $2.00 x $2.00 x $2.00 Expenditure ($3,600) ($7,200) ($36,000) ($21,600) ($36,000) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Judicial Branch states this bill enacts no new offenses, however, voter fraud provisions of RSA 659:34 still apply. The Judicial Branch has no information on which to estimate how many additional or fewer charges will result from this bill under RSA 659:34. The Judicial Branch notes that over the last decade there have been only six voter fraud cases prosecuted in the district or superior courts. Assuming this historical trend continues, and this bill does not change the historical trend, the Branch expects minimal fiscal impact as a result of this bill. The New Hampshire Association of Counties states, to the extent more individuals are charged, convicted, and sentenced to incarceration in a county correctional facility, the counties may have increased expenditures. The Association is unable to determine the number of individuals who might be charged, convicted, or incarcerated as a result of this bill to determine an exact fiscal impact. The average annual cost to incarcerate an individual in a county correctional facility is approximately $35,000. There is no impact on county revenue. The Judicial Council, noting this bill does not modify the criminal penalties for violating the laws related to voter registration nor the consequences of giving false information regarding one&#8217;s identity or domicile, states the Council has not had to expend funds to provide indigent defense representation to anyone charged with voter fraud or a violation of RSA 654 over the last ten years. The Council assumes this bill would have no fiscal impact because the number of voter fraud cases prosecuted in the state will remain unchanged in the future. The Department of Justice states no fiscal impact would result from this bill because any investigations and prosecutions would be absorbed within the Department&#8217;s existing budget.
