The secretary of state shall prepare voting instructions for straight ticket voting for each of the political parties listed on the ballot which shall be placed on the top of the general election ballot. 656:11-b Party Emblem. There shall be for straight ticket voting an emblem designating or distinguishing the political party. The emblem or device shall be selected by the secretary of state for each political party represented upon the ballot and shall be different for each of such parties and may be any appropriate symbol; but neither the coat of arms nor the seal of any state, nor of the United States, nor the national flag, nor any religious emblem or symbol, nor the portrait of any person, nor the representation of a coin nor of the currency of the United States shall be chosen as a distinguishing emblem. 2 Marking the Ballot; Instructions to Voters. Amend RSA 659:17 to read as follows: 659:17 Marking the Ballot; Instructions to Voters. The secretary of state shall provide on the top of the general election ballot the following voting instructions. The secretary of state is authorized to replace the phrase &#8220;Make the appropriate mark&#8221; with an appropriate description and example of the mark to be made for the type of ballot in use, such as &#8220;Make a cross (X) in the box,&#8221; &#8220;Completely fill in the oval,&#8221; or &#8220;Complete the arrow&#8221;: 1) To Vote Make the appropriate mark to the right of your choice. For each office vote for not more than the number of candidates stated in the sentence: &#8220;Vote for not more than ___.&#8221; If you vote for more than the stated number of candidates, your vote for that office will not be counted. 2) To Vote a Straight Ticket To vote for all candidates running in the same political party (straight ticket), make the appropriate mark to the right of the party name in the straight ticket section of the ballot. You may vote a straight ticket and also vote for individual candidates from any party. If you vote for an individual candidate, the straight ticket vote for only that office is canceled. If more than one candidate is to be elected for an office, you must mark each of your choices for that office. If you vote a straight ticket and do not make the appropriate mark to the right of any candidate for an office, your straight ticket vote will count for that office. 3) To Vote by Write-In To vote for a person whose name is not printed on the ballot, write in the name of the person in the &#8220;write-in&#8221; space. Make the appropriate mark to the right of your choice. 3 New Section; Counting Straight Party Vote. Amend RSA 659 by inserting after section 66 the following new section: 659:66-a Counting Straight Party Vote. If, in accordance with RSA 659:17, a ballot is marked to indicate a straight party vote, but an appropriate mark is beside the name of a candidate of a different party for any office, or the name of a person is written on the lines for write-in votes, then the vote so appropriately marked or so written on the lines for write-in votes shall be counted and shall override the straight party vote for that office. 4 Effective Date. This act shall take effect 60 days after its passage.
