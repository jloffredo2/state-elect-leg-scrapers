If a ballot is marked for any office or horizontal line in a way which does not readily admit of counting or if a disagreement over how to count the ballot for any office or horizontal line occurs among the election officers present and counting votes, then the ballot shall be counted for that office or horizontal line in accordance with the majority vote of the election officials present and counting votes; provided that, if no alternative count receives a majority vote, the ballot shall be regarded as defective for that office or horizontal line as provided in RSA 659:65. 5 Defective Ballots.

If a voter writes in the name of a candidate whose name appears on the ballot as the nominee of a party for the same office but in a different horizontal line than that in which the voter has entered the name as a write-in candidate, such write-in vote shall only be counted if the voter did not also vote for the candidate on the horizontal line in which his or her name appears. 8 Canvass and Declaration.
