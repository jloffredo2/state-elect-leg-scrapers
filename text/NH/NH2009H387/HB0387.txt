Be it Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened: 127:1 New Section; Observation of Voter Registration. Amend RSA 654 by inserting after section 7-b the following new section: 654:7-c Observation to Voter Registration. Any person shall have a right, as safety, welfare, and rights of voters permit, to observe in-person voter registration, wherever it is conducted, provided however, that the person may not be positioned within 5 feet of the voter registration table where the exchange of nonpublic information between the applicant for registration and the election official receiving the application may be heard or seen. When a person registers to vote on election day, the ballot clerk, upon adding the person&#8217;s name to the checklist at the check-in table, shall publicly announce the person&#8217;s name 2 times and shall publicly announce the address the person has registered as his or her domicile one time. These announcements shall be made in a manner that allows any person appointed as a challenger to hear the announcement. Where the physical layout of a polling place makes it impractical to position challengers or interested voters who are registered at that polling place where they can hear the announcement at the check-in table, the moderator shall arrange an alternative means for challengers or interested voters who are registered to vote at that polling place to be informed of the new voter&#8217;s name and domicile address and be afforded an opportunity to challenge the voter at the check-in table. 127:2 Effective Date. This act shall take effect 60 days after its passage. Approved: June 22, 2009 Effective Date: August 21, 2009
