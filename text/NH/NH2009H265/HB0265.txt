The supervisors may refuse to add the name of an applicant to the checklist if he or she fails to present the evidence or an affidavit as required by this section. Without limiting the acceptance of other forms of proof of domicile or identity deemed reasonable by the supervisors: (a) Any one of the following documents is presumptive evidence that the individual seeking to vote meets the domicile requirement, provided the document is currently valid, was issued to or in the name of the applicant, and shows the address the applicant claims as a domicile: (1) New Hampshire driver's license. (2) New Hampshire vehicle registration. (3) Armed services identification, or other photo identification issued by the United States government. (b) Any one of the following is presumptive evidence of the identity of an applicant sufficient to satisfy the identity requirement for an official authorized by RSA 659:30 to take the oath of an applicant swearing to a <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">citizenship</strike> qualified voter , domicile, or election day affidavit: (1) Photo driver's license issued by any state or the federal government. (2) United States passport, armed services identification, or other photo identification issued by the United States government. (3) Photo identification issued by local or state government. (c) The presumptions established in this paragraph may be defeated by evidence establishing that it is more likely than not that the applicant is not qualified as a voter. III. To prove the qualifications set forth in paragraphs I and II, an applicant for registration as a voter must prove his or her identity to establish that the evidence used to prove age, citizenship, and domicile relate to the applicant. A person who has in his or her immediate possession a photo identification approved for use by paragraph II must present that identification when applying for registration. A person who does not have an approved photo identification with him or her may establish identity through any reasonable means, including, but not limited to: photo identification not approved by paragraph II, but determined to be legitimate by the supervisors of the checklist or clerk, verification of the person's identity by another person registered as a voter and known to the supervisor or clerk, or completion of the qualified voter affidavit <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">to be completed by a challenged voter</strike>. Residents of a nursing home or similar facility may prove their identity through verification of identity by the administrator of the facility or by his or her designee. For the purposes of this section, the application of a person whose identity has been verified by an official of a nursing home or similar facility shall be treated in the same manner as the application of a person who proved his or her identity with a photo identification. 278:2 Reference Changed. Amend RSA 654:31-a to read as follows: 654:31-a Right to Know Exemption. The information contained on the checklist of a town or city, specifically, the name, street address, mailing address, town or city, and party affiliation, if any, of registered voters, except as otherwise provided by statute, is public information subject to RSA 91-A.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">citizenship</strike> qualified voter and domicile affidavits are public records subject to RSA 91-A for the sole purpose of challenging an individual registering to vote or voting, challenging ballots to be recounted, to the extent that such ballot challenges are specifically authorized by law, or determining the accuracy of any <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">citizenship</strike> qualified voter or domicile affidavit. Election officials and law enforcement personnel in furtherance of their official duties may access and may disclose information from the voter registration form, <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">citizenship</strike> qualified voter and domicile affidavits, absentee registration affidavits, and applications for absentee ballots, if necessary to resolve a challenge to an individual registering to vote or voting, or if necessary to investigate or prosecute election law violations or any crime. Law enforcement access and use of such records for the investigation or prosecution of crimes unrelated to election law violations shall be limited to the records of the specific individuals who are the subject of the investigation or prosecution. 278:3 Challenge of Voter; Affidavit. Amend RSA 659:27 to read as follows: 659:27 Challenge of Voter; Affidavit.

Amend RSA 659:101 to read as follows: 659:101 Preservation of Absentee Voting Materials, Election Day Affidavits, and Domicile Affidavits. The affidavit envelopes and application forms processed by the moderator as provided in RSA 659:50, and the <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">citizenship</strike> qualified voter affidavits and domicile affidavits as provided in RSA 654:12 and any other documentary proof of qualifications retained by the town or city clerk, the supervisors of the checklist, or other election official may be preserved in the same manner that ballots are preserved. <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">Citizenship</strike> Qualified voter , voter registration, and domicile affidavits shall be retained for 3 years after the election in which they are used, and other materials may be destroyed one year after the first state general election at which the individual may vote. 278:7 Effective Date.
