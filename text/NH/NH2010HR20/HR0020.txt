Whereas, those serving in the U.S. military deserve the highest level of support from the federal government; and Whereas, the right to vote and the right of a secret ballot are fundamental rights that should be protected for all those serving in the U.S. military; and Whereas, current federal ballot delivery procedures require 3 weeks or more to deliver completed ballots home, stateside, from overseas deployment; and Whereas, an express mail delivery system could reduce the delivery time back home, stateside, for overseas military ballots from 3 weeks to just 4 days; and Whereas, the Military Voting Protection Act to establish such an express mail system, H.R. 2393, sponsored by Rep. Kevin McCarthy and the identical S. 1026, sponsored by Sen. John Cornyn, has bipartisan support as introduced in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives: That the New Hampshire house of representatives urges all members of Congress to co-sponsor the Military Voting Protection Act as introduced in their designated body and to work for its speedy enactment in order to protect the integrity of the ballot process of our U.S. military deployed overseas during election cycles.
