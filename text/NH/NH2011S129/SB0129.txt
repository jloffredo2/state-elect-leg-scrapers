VETOED June 27, 2011 LBAO 11-0420 Amended 05/16/11 SB 129-FN - FISCAL NOTE AN ACT relative to presenting photo identification to vote in person and relative to the election fund. FISCAL IMPACT: The Department of State states this bill, <u class="amendmentInsertedText">as amended by the House (Amendment #2011-1712h)</u>, will increase state expenditures by $19,000 in FY 2012, $80,670 in FY 2013, $10,000 in FY 2014, and $103,840 in FY 2015. The Department of Safety states this bill will increase state highway fund expenditures by $9,000 in FY 2012. The New Hampshire Municipal Association states this bill will have an indeterminable impact on local expenditures. There will be no impact on state, county or local revenues or county expenditures. METHODOLOGY: The Department of State states section 1 of this bill would require ballot clerks to enter out-of-state driver&#8217;s license information, if one is used for voter identification, on the checklist and report it to the Department. The Department estimates one-time cost of adding an additional field to the searchable elections database for this purpose of approximately $10,000. The Department states section 2 of this bill would require two sets of envelopes in which to place provisional ballots. The Department estimates the cost of an additional set of envelopes would be $6,130 per election. The Department states section 2 of this bill requires seals and labels to indentify boxes containing provisional ballots. The Department estimates a total cost of $910 per election. The Department also states it is authorized in section 2 to grant waivers of the photo identification requirement upon presentation of sworn evidence during the same period in which the Department is engaged in post election procedures. The Department estimates the total cost of employing hearings officers for this process would be approximately $10,000 per election (1000 total waiver requests handled at 15 minutes each with the hearings officer compensated $40 per hour). The Department states section 4 of this bill authorizes municipal clerks to issue vouchers for identification cards to be issued by the Division of Motor Vehicles, for which the $10 fee for such a card would be paid from the election fund. The Department estimates 4,650 vouchers may be issued during an election cycle for a total of $46,500 (4,650 X $10 fee). The Department states section 6 of this bill requires voter education using the Department of State&#8217;s website and printing notices to be posted by the clerks in each town and ward. The Department estimates this will cost approximately $1,000 per election cycle. The following is a summary of the costs associated with this bill as identified by the Department of State by state fiscal year and applicable elections: &#160; FY 2012 FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 Section 1 $10,000 $0 $0 $0 Section 2 $0 $33,170 $10,000 $56,340 Section 4 $0 $46,500 $0 $46,500 Section 6 $0 $1,000 $0 $1,000 Total $10,000 $80,670 $10,000 $103,840 <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> Elections Impacted </u> FY 2012 &#8211; No Elections FY 2013 &#8211; State General, Municipal FY 2014 &#8211; Municipal FY 2015 &#8211; State Primary, State General, Municipal The Department of Safety states this bill establishes a new version of a non-driver&#8217;s identification for &#8220;voter identification only&#8221;, which would be issued by the Division of Motor Vehicles. The Department states it would incur $9,000 of highway fund expenditures in fiscal year 2012 for programming and form changes for the new identification card. The New Hampshire Municipal Association states provisions in this bill would increase the time needed for each voter to check-in and vote and increase the workload for election officials. The Association states municipalities may need to respond to this increase by appointing additional election officials or extending polling hours, which in either case would likely be an increase in local expenditures to compensate election officials. The Association states the effect and costs would vary among municipalities and therefore is unable to determine the amount of any fiscal impact. The Office of Legislative Budget Assistant is awaiting responses from the New Hampshire Association of Counties, Judicial Council, Judicial Branch, and Department of Justice relative to the fiscal impact, if any, which may result from criminal penalties associated with this bill.
