Amend RSA 659 by inserting after section 13 the following new section: 659:13-a Optional Procedure for Obtaining a Ballot. I. The legislative body of a municipality may adopt the alternative procedure for obtaining a ballot established in paragraph II. Upon adoption, the alternative procedure shall be followed in lieu of the procedure established in RSA 659:13 at all elections in the municipality. If the legislative body votes to discontinue use of the alternative procedure for obtaining a ballot, the procedure established in RSA 659:13 shall be followed at all elections in the municipality held after such vote. The governing body of the municipality shall notify the secretary of state of the adoption of the alternative procedure for obtaining a ballot or of the vote to discontinue the alternative procedure for obtaining a ballot. II. In municipalities adopting the procedures in this paragraph, a person desiring to vote shall, before being admitted to the enclosed space within the guardrail, announce his or her name and present his or her New Hampshire driver's license, armed services identification card, United&#160;States passport, or any other form of photographic identification to one of the ballot clerks who shall thereupon repeat the name; and, if the name is found on the checklist by the ballot clerk, the ballot clerk shall put a checkmark beside it and again repeat the name. If the person does not have his or her driver's license, passport, or other form of photographic identification, the ballot clerk shall notify the person of the affidavit provided for in RSA 659:27. The voter, unless challenged as provided for in RSA 659:27-33, or unless failing to present proper identification and failing to sign an affidavit, shall then be allowed to enter the space enclosed by the guardrail. After the voter enters the enclosed space, the ballot clerk shall give the voter one of each ballot to be voted on in that election which shall be folded as it was upon receipt from the secretary of state. 3 Preservation of Challenge Affidavits.
