FISCAL IMPACT: The Department of State estimates this bill will increase state general fund expenditures by $135,000 in FY 2003, $157,720 in FY 2004, $131,551 in FY 2005, $135,498 in FY 2006, and $139,564 in FY 2007. There will be no fiscal impact on state, county, and local revenue or county and local expenditures. METHODOLOGY: The Department states this bill would require the training of more than 5,000 local election officials annually. Additionally, the Department would have to maintain a register of which election officials completed training on an annual basis making them eligible to work as an election official. Several levels of training would also be necessary to train new versus seasoned election officials, as well as training for the various job functions in the polling place. At a minimum, the Department would require a Training Coordinator, Administrative Assistant, and Clerical Assistant, and necessary office supplies. Since FY 2004 is a Presidential Primary year, the Department would require additional resources to provide training in the calendar year of the election. Assuming benefits at 37%, and inflation of 3% per year, the Department estimates the costs as follows: FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Staff Costs $117,000 $120,510 $124,125 $127,849 $131,685 Supplies 11,000 0 0 0 0 Mileage 7,000 7,210 7,426 7,649 7,879 Primary 0 30,000 0 0 0 Total $135,000 $157,720 $131,551 $135,498 $139,564
