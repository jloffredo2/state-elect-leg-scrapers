FISCAL IMPACT: The Department of State indicates this bill, <u class="amendmentInsertedText">as introduced</u> , will decrease state general fund expenditures by $143,442 in FY 2014, and increase state general fund expenditures by $143,442 in FY 2015, by $64,715 in FY 2016, and $64,747 in FY 2017. The New Hampshire Municipal Association states this bill may increase expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2014 and may decrease expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2015 and each year thereafter. There is no fiscal impact on state, county, or local revenue or county expenditures. METHODOLOGY: The Department of State states this bill would delay implementation, until September 1, 2014, of sections of Chapter 284, Laws of 2012 relative to voter ID requirements scheduled to become effective September 1, 2013. The Department states this bill would delay for one year the requirement to place digital cameras and printers in polling locations so $81,675 in equipment expense could be delayed until FY 2015 as could $10,000 in maintenance expenditures. A Program Assistant II position would also not need to be filled until FY 2015. The table below identifies expenditures in the year they would be incurred. <u class="amendmentInsertedText"> FY 2014 FY 2015 FY 2016 FY 2017 </u> Program Assistant II (Labor Grade 15, Step 1) ($51,767) $51,767 $54,715 $57,747 Camera &amp; Printers ($81,675) $81,675 $0 $0 Equipment Maintenance<u class="amendmentInsertedText"> ($10,000) $10,000 $10,000 $10,000</u> ($143,442) $143,442 $64,715 $67,747 The New Hampshire Municipal Association states the delay in implementing the voter identification process for one year may decrease expenditures in FY 2014 and may increase expenditures in FY 2015 and each year thereafter. The Association states this bill may increase the time, workload, and costs for local officials starting in FY 2015 but is not able to determine the exact impact on local expenditures. The Department of Safety states it has already incurred the costs to implement the voter identification requirements expected to go into effect on September 1, 2013. Therefore, the Department of Safety states this bill will have no fiscal impact. The Department of Justice states this bill will have no fiscal impact on its operations.
