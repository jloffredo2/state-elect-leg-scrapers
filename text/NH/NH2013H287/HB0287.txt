LBAO 13-0065 01/15/13 HB 287-FN - FISCAL NOTE AN ACT eliminating voter identification requirements. FISCAL IMPACT: The Department of State indicates this bill, <u class="amendmentInsertedText">as introduced</u> , will decrease state expenditures by $158,960 in FY 2014, $98,215 in FY 2015, $102,747 in FY 2016, and $105,983 in FY 2017. The Department of Justice, Judicial Council, New Hampshire Association of Counties, and New Hampshire Municipal Association state this bill would decrease state, county, and local expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2014 and each year thereafter. This bill will have no fiscal impact on state, county, and local revenue. METHODOLOGY: The Department of State indicates this bill will repeal requirements for voter identification and verification. The Department states general fund expenditures would decrease by eliminating the Program Assistant II position created to train local election officials and also repeals the requirement to send a verification mailing to voters who did not show an acceptable form of identification. Based on their experience in the 2012 general election, the Department estimates approximately 1% of voters on Election Day did not have an acceptable identification. The Department estimates approximately 3,000 voters for the FY 2014 elections and 9,500 voters in FY 2015 would present without acceptable identification and would need mail verification. The Department estimates each mailing costs $3 per piece for a total of $9,000 in FY 2014 ($3 x 3,000 voters) and $28,500 in FY 2015 ($3 x 9,500 voters). The Department states very few individuals sought voter ID cards from the Division of Motor Vehicles during the 2012 election cycle so they estimate a decrease in state general fund expenditures of $5,000 (500 voter ID cards at a cost of $10 each). The Department states this bill would repeal the requirement to place digital cameras and printers in polling locations so $81,675 in equipment expenses would not be needed as well as $10,000 in maintenance expenditures. The Department states it can absorb the costs of printing and modifying its forms within its current budget. The table below identifies decreases in expenditures due to this bill. FY 2014 FY 2015 FY 2016 FY 2017 Program Assistant II (Labor Grade 15, Step 1) ($53,285) ($54,715) ($57,747) ($60,983) Verification Mailings ($9,000) ($28,500) ($30,000) ($30,000) Non Driver Photo IDs ($5,000) ($5,000) ($5,000) ($5,000) Camera &amp; Printers ($81,675) ($0) ($0) ($0) Equipment Maintenance (<u class="amendmentInsertedText">$10,000) ($10,000) ($10,000) ($10,000)</u> ($158,960) ($98,215) ($102,747) ($105,983) The Department of Justice states this bill would eliminate the need for the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to investigate any returned domicile affidavits executed by voters who did not display an approved identification at the time he or she voted. The Department states the fiscal impact of the investigations that may be triggered from the 2012 General Election is not yet known and, therefore, the fiscal impact is indeterminable. The Judicial Council states this bill decreases the offense level from a class B felony to a class A misdemeanor which would result in decreased expenditures. The Judicial Council states no indigents have needed representation related to voter fraud in the last ten years. Nevertheless, to the extent that class A misdemeanor penalties are sought, the state would be subject to expenditures of approximately $275 for each misdemeanor case handled by a public defender or contract attorney rather than $756.24 for a felony case. If an assigned counsel attorney is used, the fee is $60 per hour with a cap of $1,400 for a misdemeanor and a cap of $4,100 for a felony. The Council also states additional costs could be incurred if an appeal is filed. The public defender, contract attorney, and assigned counsel rates for Supreme Court appeals is $2,000 per case. Expenditures would increase if services other than counsel are requested and approved by the court during the defense of a case or during an appeal. The New Hampshire Association of Counties states, to the extent fewer individuals are charged, convicted, and sentenced to incarceration in a county correctional facility, the counties may have decreased expenditures. The Association is unable to determine the number of individuals who might avoid prosecution and incarceration as a result of this bill to determine an exact fiscal impact. The average annual cost to incarcerate an individual in a county correctional facility is approximately $35,000. There is no impact on county revenue. The New Hampshire Municipal Association states the repeal of the voter identification process may decrease the time, workload, and costs for local election officials. The Association is not able to determine the exact impact on local expenditures. The Department of Safety states this bill will have no fiscal impact on state expenditures or revenue.
