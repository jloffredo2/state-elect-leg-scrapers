Be it Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened: 9:1 Eligibility; Voter; Domicile. Amend RSA 654:1, I to read as follows: I. Every inhabitant of the state, having a single established domicile for voting purposes, being a citizen of the United States, of the age provided for in Article 11 of Part First of the Constitution of New Hampshire, shall have a right at any meeting or election, to vote in the town, ward, or unincorporated place in which he or she is domiciled. An inhabitant's domicile for voting purposes is that one place where a person, more than any other place, has established a physical presence and manifests an intent to maintain a single continuous presence for domestic, social, and civil purposes relevant to participating in democratic self-government. A person has the right to change domicile at any time, however a mere intention to change domicile in the future does not, of itself, terminate an established domicile before the person actually moves. A person&#8217;s claim of domicile for voting purposes shall not be conclusive of the person&#8217;s residence for any other legal purpose. 9:2 Effective Date. This act shall take effect 60 days after its passage. Approved: May 2, 2007 Effective Date: July 1, 2007
