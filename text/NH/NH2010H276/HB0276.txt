Amend RSA 659:50 and RSA 659:51 to read as follows: 659:50 Announcement by Moderator. The moderator shall begin processing absentee ballots by clearly announcing that he or she is about to open the envelopes which were delivered to him or her . The moderator shall then remove the affidavit envelope containing the ballots of each absentee voter and shall compare the signature on the affidavit envelope with the signature on the application for the ballot. If: I. The name of the voter is on the checklist , except for voters provided for in RSA 7:46 ; and II. The affidavit on the envelope appears to be properly executed; and III. The signature on the affidavit appears to be executed by the same person who signed the application; and IV. The signatures appear to be the signatures of a duly qualified voter who has not voted at the election; then the moderator shall publicly announce the name of the absentee voter , except for voters provided for in RSA 7:46 . If these conditions are not met, the moderator shall follow the procedure provided in RSA 659:53. 659:51 Challenges. I. All absentee ballots are subject to challenge after the moderator publicly announces the name of the absentee voter , except for voters provided for in RSA 7:46, but not after the ballot is removed from the envelope. <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">A person who makes a challenge shall state the reason for the challenge.</strike> No challenge to an absentee ballot may be asserted except in conformity with the requirements of RSA 659:27-a. II.

If the moderator decides that the challenge is not well grounded, he or she shall open the affidavit envelope so the affidavit thereon is not destroyed and proceed first to mark on the reverse of the folded ballot the corresponding challenge number as previously marked on the envelope. <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">He</strike> The moderator shall then proceed to deposit the ballot as provided in RSA 659:52. 4 Effective Date. This act shall take effect January 1, 2010. Vetoed: February 12, 2010 Veto Sustained May 19, 2010 LBAO 09-0136 01/07/09 HB 276-FN - FISCAL NOTE AN ACT relative to challenges of voters. FISCAL IMPACT: The Judicial Branch, the Judicial Council, and the New Hampshire Association of Counties state this bill may increase state and county expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2010 and each year thereafter. There will be no fiscal impact on local expenditures or state, county, and local revenue. METHODOLOGY: The Judicial Branch states this bill establishes additional guidelines for challenging voter qualifications and establishes a class A misdemeanor for individuals that engage in prohibited challenges. The Judicial Branch states it has no information to estimate how many class A misdemeanor charges would be brought as a result of this bill. The Branch states the cost of a class A misdemeanor in the district court is $51.14 in FY 2010 and each year thereafter. The Branch estimates it would take 196 cases in FY 2010 and each year thereafter to have a fiscal impact exceeding $10,000. The possibility of appeals makes the number of cases needed for a fiscal impact over $10,000 significantly fewer. Judicial Branch statistics show, however, that from January 1, 1999 to June 30, 2008, five charges of violation of Chapter 659 have been brought in the district courts. Based on that historic volume, the Judicial Branch does not anticipate a significant fiscal impact. The Judicial Council states this bill may result in increased general fund expenditures but cannot predict the number of violations therefore the fiscal impact cannot be determined at this time. The Council states if an individual is found to be indigent, the flat fee of $275 per misdemeanor is charged by a public defender or contract attorney. If an assigned counsel attorney is used, the fee is $60 per hour with a cap of $1,400. A juvenile misdemeanor case is $275 through disposition, plus $137 for each review hearing following disposition. Assigned counsel attorneys for juvenile cases will be $60 per hour with a fee cap of $1,700 through disposition, and the maximum fee for court review hearings of juvenile cases is $300. These fee caps may be waived upon motion filed in advance and approved by the court, and such motions are routinely granted. The Council states additional costs could be incurred if an appeal is filed. The public defender, contract attorney, and assigned counsel rates for Supreme Court appeals will be $2,000 per case, with many assigned counsel attorneys seeking permission to exceed the fee cap. However, such motions to exceed the fee cap are seldom granted. Finally, expenditures would increase if services other than counsel are requested and approved by the court during the defense of a case or during an appeal. The New Hampshire Association of Counties states to the extent any individual is prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to incarceration, the counties may have increased expenditures. The Association is unable to determine the number of individuals who might be detained or incarcerated as a result of this bill. The average annual cost to incarcerate an individual in a county facility is $30,165.
