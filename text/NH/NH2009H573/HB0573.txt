LBAO 09-0449 01/21/09 HB 573-FN - FISCAL NOTE AN ACT relative to absentee voting. FISCAL IMPACT: The New Hampshire Municipal Association and Department of State state this bill will increase local expenditures and decrease state expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2010 and each year thereafter. This bill will have no fiscal impact on state, county and local revenue, or county expenditures. METHODOLOGY: The New Hampshire Municipal Association states this bill would allow any voter to vote by absentee ballot at any election, without any requirement that the voter be absent or unable to appear at the polling place. Allowing unrestricted absentee voting is likely to lead to significant increase in the number of voters choosing to vote by absentee ballot. This will require increased time, and therefore possibly increased expenditures for municipal election officials to mail and process applications, mail ballots, and open and process ballots when they are received. It also will require municipalities to pay for additional postage to mail the application and ballots. It is impossible, however, to predict how many more voters will apply for and use absentee ballots, or how much additional time will be required to process applications and ballots. The exact fiscal impact cannot be determined at this time. The Department of State states this bill eliminates the reasons necessary for a voter to request an absentee ballot. While the bill will not eliminate the forms required to be printed for absentee voting, it would reduce the amount of text printed on those forms. The Department states they are unable to determine the extent to which printing costs would be reduced, but the savings would not be significant.
