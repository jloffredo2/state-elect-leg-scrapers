A person desiring to vote at a state or presidential primary election shall, at the time of announcing the person&#8217;s name, also announce the name of the party to which the person belongs or whether the person is registered as an <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">undeclared</strike> independent voter. If the person&#8217;s party membership has been registered before, the person shall be given only the ballot of the party with which the person is registered, unless the person desires to vote the ballot of a party not having official existence at the time the person&#8217;s party membership was previously registered, in which case the person may vote the ballot of such a party in the state primary election immediately following the political organization&#8217;s official existence as a party, and not in any subsequent state primary election. A person may also vote the ballot of such a party in the presidential primary election only if the presidential primary election precedes the state primary election to be held in that same year. If the rules of a party permit a person who is registered as an <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">undeclared</strike> independent voter to vote in the party&#8217;s primary, any person desiring to vote in that party&#8217;s primary shall also announce the name of that party at the time of announcing the person&#8217;s name.
