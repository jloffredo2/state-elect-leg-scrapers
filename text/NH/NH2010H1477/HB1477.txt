Be it Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened: 366:1 Preparing Checklist. Amend RSA 654:25 to read as follows: 654:25 Preparing Checklist. The secretary of state shall issue and distribute guidelines for the composition and style of checklists and for the maintenance of data related to checklists by which the supervisors of the checklist shall compile and correct the checklist. Such guidelines shall specify the information which will be maintained and updated by the supervisors. The secretary shall establish standard forms and procedures for the use of the supervisors for the maintenance of such information. The information to be maintained and updated shall include the full name, domicile address, mailing address, and party affiliation, if any, of each voter on the checklist and such other information as the secretary requires. Every checklist used at any election shall contain the full name, domicile address, mailing address, and party affiliation, if any, of each voter on the checklist. The paper checklists used by ballot clerks on election day need not include mailing addresses. The name and address of a voter shall not appear on the checklist at the request of the voter if the voter presents to the supervisors of the checklist a valid protective order pursuant to RSA 173-B. The name, domicile address, and mailing address, if different, of such a voter shall be maintained on a separate list of voters, which shall be nonpublic and not subject to RSA 91-A. If it is necessary to establish such a nonpublic list, the public checklist shall be marked at the end with a notation of the number of voters whose names are maintained on the nonpublic list. 366:2 Checklist and Voter Information. Amend RSA 654:31, IV to read as follows: IV. The secretary of state shall, upon request, provide to a political party, as defined in RSA 664:2, IV, or to a political committee, as defined in RSA 664:2, III, a list of the name, <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">street</strike> domicile address, mailing address, town or city, voter history, and party affiliation, if any, of every registered voter in the state. The secretary of state shall, upon request, provide to a candidate for county, state, or federal office a list of the name, <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">street</strike> domicile address, mailing address, town or city, voter history, and party affiliation, if any, of every registered voter in the state or in the candidate&#8217;s district. In this section, &#8220;voter history&#8221; means whether the person voted and, for primary elections, in which party&#8217;s primary the person voted, in each state election for the preceding 2 years. The secretary of state shall charge a fee of $25 plus $0.50 per thousand names or portion thereof in excess of 2,500 plus shipping charges for each copy of the list provided under this section. In addition, the secretary of state shall charge and collect on behalf of and remit to the supervisors of the checklist of each city and town the amount that such supervisors would have charged had the public checklist of their city or town been purchased from them. The secretary of state may provide lists as prescribed in this section on paper, computer disk, computer tape, electronic transfer, or any other form. 366:3 Right to Know Exemption. Amend RSA 654:31-a to read as follows: 654:31-a Right to Know Exemption. The information contained on the checklist of a town or city, specifically, the name, <strike class="amendmentDeletedText">street</strike> domicile address, mailing address, town or city, and party affiliation, if any, of registered voters, except as otherwise provided by statute, is public information subject to RSA 91-A. All other information on the voter registration form, absentee registration affidavit, qualified voter and domicile affidavits, and application for absentee ballot shall be treated as confidential information and the records containing this information shall be exempt from the public disclosure provisions of RSA 91-A, except as provided by statutes other than RSA 91-A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, qualified voter and domicile affidavits are public records subject to RSA 91-A for the sole purpose of challenging an individual registering to vote or voting, challenging ballots to be recounted, to the extent that such ballot challenges are specifically authorized by law, or determining the accuracy of any qualified voter or domicile affidavit. Election officials and law enforcement personnel in furtherance of their official duties may access and may disclose information from the voter registration form, qualified voter and domicile affidavits, absentee registration affidavits, and applications for absentee ballots, if necessary to resolve a challenge to an individual registering to vote or voting, or if necessary to investigate or prosecute election law violations or any crime. Law enforcement access and use of such records for the investigation or prosecution of crimes unrelated to election law violations shall be limited to the records of the specific individuals who are the subject of the investigation or prosecution. 366:4 Challenge of Voter; Affidavit. RSA 659:27 is repealed and reenacted to read as follows: 659:27 Challenge of Voter; Affidavit. I. A voter offering to vote at any state election may be challenged by any other voter registered in the town or ward in which the election is held, an election official, a challenger appointed by a political committee pursuant to RSA 666:4, or a challenger appointed by the attorney general pursuant to RSA 666:5. II. Upon receipt of a written challenge, the moderator shall determine if the challenge to the ballot is well grounded.

If the moderator determines that the challenge is not well grounded, the moderator shall permit the voter to proceed to vote. III. No voter or appointed challenger shall challenge a person&#8217;s qualifications to be a voter at the election day voter registration table. 366:5 New Section; Asserting a Challenge.
