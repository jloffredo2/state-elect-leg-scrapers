Be it Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened: 1 Eligibility; Voter; Domicile. Amend RSA 654:1, I to read as follows: I. Every inhabitant of the state, having a single established domicile for voting purposes, being a citizen of the United States, of the age provided for in Article 11 of Part First of the Constitution of New Hampshire, shall have a right at any meeting or election, to vote in the town, ward, or unincorporated place in which he or she is domiciled. An inhabitant&#8217;s domicile for voting purposes is that one place where a person, more than any other place, has established a physical presence and manifests an intent to maintain a single continuous presence for domestic, social, and civil purposes relevant to participating in democratic self-government. A person has the right to change domicile at any time, however a mere intention to change domicile in the future does not, of itself, terminate an established domicile before the person actually moves. A person&#8217;s claim of domicile for voting purposes shall not be conclusive of the person&#8217;s residence for any other legal purpose. However, where the person has a permanent residence, that residence shall be considered the person&#8217;s domicile for the purpose of voting. 2 Effective Date. This act shall take effect 60 days after its passage.
