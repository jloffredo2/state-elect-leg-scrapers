FISCAL IMPACT: The New Hampshire Municipal Association and the Department of State this bill may increase local expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2010 and each fiscal year thereafter. There will be no fiscal impact on state or county expenditures and state, county, or local revenue. METHODOLOGY: The New Hampshire Municipal Association states this legislation would require a security escort to accompany the moderator or the selectman or their designees when they deliver ballot boxes to the town or city clerk after state and local elections. The Association states, to the extent municipalities would be required to pay someone to perform the service of a security escort, they would experience an increase in costs of an indeterminable amount. The Association maintains that the proposed legislation lacks both a definition for the term &#8216;security escort&#8217; and an indication of who could serve in that capacity, so it cannot reasonably estimate what the fiscal impact would be. The Department of State states this proposed bill may increase expenditures by an indeterminable amount at the local level. This bill does not contain an appropriation.
