There will be no fiscal impact on state and county expenditures or state, county and local revenue. METHODOLOGY: The New Hampshire Municipal Association states this would require town moderators to post at each polling place, in advance of elections, a description of areas at that polling place where electioneering activities are permitted and prohibited. Local expenditures may increase depending on how the moderator is compensated in a given town, and the number of polling places in each town. The exact fiscal impact cannot be determined at this time.
