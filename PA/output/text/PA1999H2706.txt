15  polling place within the elector's county of residence.
16     (4)  A qualified elector shall retire to one of the voting
17  booths in which the Internet voting machines are located.
18     (5)  The elector shall visit the Internet balloting web page
19  for his county and authenticate himself to that server by
20  entering any personal information required for authentication
21  and request a ballot.
22     (6)  The server shall send an image of the appropriate ballot
23  back to the elector.
24     (7)  The elector shall mark the ballot with the keyboard,
25  mouse or touch screen if the machine is so equipped.
26     (8)  When the elector is finished making his choices, he
27  shall click a button on the screen to send the ballot. A screen
28  will then be displayed that shows all of the elector's choices
29  for verification. When the elector confirms the selections, the
30  ballot is encrypted and sent to the central vote server. If the
1  elector does not confirm the selections, the ballot is reset and
2  he has the option of remarking the ballot.
3     (9)  When the vote server receives the ballot, it will verify
4  that it has been sent from a qualified elector who has not yet
5  voted and has not been altered in any form during transmission.
6     (10)  Once the vote has been verified, the server will send
7  feedback to the voter acknowledging that the vote has been
8  accepted.
9     (11)  The server then separates the vote from the
10  identification of the elector and stores the vote for counting.
11     (12)  After the polls close for the day, the county elections
12  officials, one being from each party, shall enter their separate

18  voting system to be used at any primary or election, or who
19  shall prevent or attempt to prevent the correct operation and
20  communication of such a system, or any unauthorized person who
21  shall make or have in his possession a decryption key to an
22  Internet voting system to be used or being used in any primary
23  or election, shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction
24  thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than fifty
25  thousand dollars ($50,000) and not to exceed one hundred
26  thousand dollars ($100,000), or to undergo an imprisonment of
27  not less than ten years, but not more than twenty years, or
28  both, at the discretion of the court.
