19     Section 2.  Section 976 of the act, amended July 28, 1941
20  (P.L.526, No.213) and February 19, 1986 (P.L.29, No.11) and
21  repealed in part April 28, 1978 (P.L.202, No.53), is amended to
22  read:
23     Section 976.  Examination of Nomination Petitions,
24  Certificates and Papers; Return of Rejected Nomination
25  Petitions, Certificates and Papers.--When any nomination
26  petition, nomination certificate or nomination paper is
27  presented in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth or
28  of any county board of elections for filing within the period
29  limited by this act, it shall be the duty of the said officer or
30  board to examine the same. No nomination petition, nomination
1  paper or nomination certificate shall be permitted to be filed
2  if--(a) it contains material errors or defects apparent on the
3  face thereof, or on the face of the appended or accompanying
4  affidavits; or (b) it contains material alterations made after
5  signing without the consent of the signers; or (c) it does not
6  contain a sufficient number of signatures as required by law;
7  Provided, however, That the Secretary of the Commonwealth or the
8  county board of elections, although not hereby required so to
9  do, may question the genuineness of any signature or signatures
10  appearing thereon, and if he or it shall thereupon find that any
11  such signature or signatures are not genuine, such signature or
12  signatures shall be disregarded in determining whether the
13  nomination petition, nomination paper or nomination certificate
14  contains a sufficient number of signatures as required by law;
15  or (d) in the case of nomination petitions, if nomination
16  petitions have been filed for printing the name of the same
17  person for the same office, except the office of judge of a
18  court of common pleas, the Philadelphia Municipal Court or the
19  Traffic Court of Philadelphia, or the office of school director
20  in districts where that office is elective or the office of
21  justice of the peace upon the official ballot of more than one
22  political party; or (e) in the case of nomination papers, if the
23  candidate named therein has filed a nomination petition for any
24  public office for the [ensuing] primary election in the year in
25  which the nomination paper is being filed, or has been nominated
26  for any such office by nomination papers previously filed; or
27  (f) if the nomination petitions or papers are not accompanied by
28  the filing fee or certified check required for said office; or
29  (g) in the case of nomination papers, the appellation set forth
30  therein is identical with or deceptively similar to the words
1  used by any existing party or by any political body which has
2  already filed nomination papers for the same office, or if the
3  appellation set forth therein contains part of the name, or an
4  abbreviation of the name or part of the name of an existing
5  political party, or of a political body which has already filed
6  nomination papers for the same office. The invalidity of any
7  sheet of a nomination petition or nomination paper shall not
8  affect the validity of such petition or paper if a sufficient
9  petition or paper remains after eliminating such invalid sheet.
10  The action of said officer or board in refusing to receive and
11  file any such nomination petition, certificate or paper, may be
12  reviewed by the court upon an application to compel its
13  reception as of the date when it was presented to the office of
14  such officer or board: Provided, however, That said officer or
15  board shall be entitled to a reasonable time in which to examine
16  any petitions, certificates or papers, and to summon and
17  interrogate the candidates named therein, or the persons
18  presenting said petitions, certificates or papers, and his or
19  their retention of same for the purpose of making such
20  examination or interrogation shall not be construed as an
21  acceptance or filing.
22     Upon completion of any examination, if any nomination
23  petition, certificate or paper is found to be defective, it
24  shall forthwith be rejected and returned to the candidate or one
25  of the candidates named therein, together with a statement of
26  the reasons for such rejection:
27     Provided further, That no nomination petition, nomination
28  paper or nomination certificate shall be permitted to be filed,
29  if the political party or political body referred to therein
30  shall be composed of a group of electors whose purposes or aims,
1  or one of whose purposes or aims, is the establishment, control,
2  conduct, seizure or overthrow of the Government of the
3  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States of America by
4  the use of force, violence, military measure or threats of one
5  or more of the foregoing. The authority to reject such
6  nomination petition, paper or certificate for this reason shall,
7  when filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth, be vested in
8  a committee composed of the Governor, the Attorney General and
9  the Secretary of the Commonwealth, and when filed with any
10  county board of elections shall be vested in such board. If in
11  such case the committee or board, as the case may be, shall
12  conclude that the acceptance of such nomination petition, paper
13  or certificate should be refused, it shall within two days of
14  the filing of such nomination petition, paper or certificate fix
15  a place and a time five days in advance for hearing the matter,
16  and notice thereof shall be given to all parties affected
17  thereby. At the time and place so fixed the committee or board,
18  as the case may be, shall hear testimony, but shall not be bound
19  by technical rules of evidence. The testimony presented shall be
20  stenographically recorded and made a part of the record of the
21  committee or board. Within two days after such hearing the
22  committee or board, if satisfied upon competent evidence that
23  the said nomination petition, paper or certificate is not
24  entitled to be accepted and filed, it shall announce its
25  decision and immediately notify the parties affected thereby.
26  Failure to announce decision within two days after such hearing
27  shall be conclusive that such nomination petition, paper or
28  certificate has been accepted and filed. The decision of said
29  committee or board in refusing to accept and file such
30  nomination petition, paper or certificate may be reviewed by the
1  court upon an application to compel its reception as of the date
2  when presented to the Secretary of the Commonwealth or such
3  board. The application shall be made within two days of the time
4  when such decision is announced. If the application is properly
5  made, any judge of said court may fix a time and place for
6  hearing the matter in dispute, of which notice shall be served
7  with a copy of said application upon the Secretary of the
8  Commonwealth or the county board of elections, as the case may
9  be. At the time so fixed, the court, or any judge thereof
10  assigned for the purpose, shall hear the case de novo. If after
11  such hearing the said court shall find that the decision of the
12  committee or the board was erroneous, it shall issue its mandate
13  to the committee or board to correct its decision and to accept
14  and file the nomination paper, petition or certificate. From any
15  decision of the court an appeal may be taken [within two days]
16  after the entry thereof. It shall be the duty of the said court
17  to fix the hearing and to announce its decision within such
18  period of time as will permit the Secretary of the Commonwealth
19  or the county board of elections to permit the names of the
20  candidates affected by the court's decision to be printed on the
21  ballot, if the court should so determine.
22     Section 3.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
