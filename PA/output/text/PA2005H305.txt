14     Section 1.  The act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known
15  as the Pennsylvania Election Code, is amended by adding a
16  section to read:
17     Section 705.  Absence from Employment to Vote.--(a)  A
18  citizen of this Commonwealth who is qualified to vote under this
19  act and is employed on the date of an election shall be
20  permitted by his employer to absent himself from employment for
21  the sole purpose of voting for a one and one-half hour period
22  during the times the polls are open without loss of pay. No
1  employer may deny an employe's absence under this section or
2  impose any disciplinary action or penalty against the employe
3  for exercising his right under this section: Provided, however,
4  That the employer may specify the hours during which the employe
5  may be absent for voting and the employe makes a request for
6  absence prior to the day of the election consistent with the
7  employer's policy, practice or custom for requesting leaves of
8  absence.
9     (b)  This section shall be inapplicable to any employe who is
10  able to vote one and one-half hour either between the opening of
11  the polls and the beginning of the employe's regular work hours
12  on the day of the election or between the end of those work
13  hours and the closing of the polls.
14     (c)  This section shall apply to any employer that has an
15  employe who works in this Commonwealth, including, but not
16  limited to, the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions.
17     (d)  Any employer that violates this section commits a
18  summary offense and shall be subject to a fine of two hundred
19  fifty dollars ($250).
20     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
