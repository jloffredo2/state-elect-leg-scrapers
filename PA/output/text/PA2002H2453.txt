1  ballot to one of the election officers who shall ascertain by an
2  inspection of the number appearing upon the right hand corner of
3  the back of the ballot whether the ballot so exhibited to him is
4  the same ballot which the elector received before entering the
5  voting compartment. If it is the same, the election officer
6  shall direct the elector, without unfolding the ballot, to
7  remove the perforated corner containing the number, and the
8  elector shall immediately deposit the ballot in the ballot box.

15     Section 4.  Sections 1107-A(3) and 1112-A(a)(4) and (b)(4) of
16  the act, added July 11, 1980 (P.L.600, No.128), are amended to
17  read:
18     Section 1107-A.  Requirements of Electronic Voting Systems.--
19  No electronic voting system shall, upon any examination or

15     Section 1112-A.  Election Day Procedures and the Process of

17  voting system in which votes are registered electronically, the
18  following procedures will be applicable for the conduct of the
19  election at the election district:
20     * * *
21     (4)  At any general election at which presidential electors
22  are to be chosen, each elector shall be permitted to vote by one
23  operation for [all the presidential electors of a political
24  party or political body.] the candidate of one political party
25  for presidential elector who is from the voter's congressional
26  district and the two at-large candidates of the same party for
27  presidential elector. For each party or body nominating
28  presidential electors, a ballot label shall be provided
29  containing only the words "Presidential Electors," preceded by
30  the names of the party or body and followed by the names of the
1  candidates thereof for the Office of President and Vice-
2  President, and the corresponding counter or registering device
3  shall register votes cast for said electors when thus voted for
4  collectively. If any elector desires to vote a ticket for
5  presidential electors made up of the names of persons nominated
6  by different parties or bodies, or partially of names of persons
7  so in nomination and partially of names of persons not in
8  nomination by any party or body, he may write or deposit a paper
9  ballot prepared by himself in the receptacle provided in or on
10  the voting device for that purpose, or he may list their names
11  on the write-in ballot or envelope provided for that purpose.
12  The voting device shall be so constructed that it will not be
13  possible for any one voter to vote a straight party ticket for
14  presidential electors and at the same time to deposit a ballot
15  for presidential electors in a receptacle as hereinabove
16  provided. When the votes for presidential electors are counted,
17  the votes appearing upon the counter or registering device
18  corresponding to the ballot label containing the names of the
19  candidates for President and Vice-President of any party or body
20  shall be counted as votes for each of the candidates for
21  presidential elector of such party or body for whom the voter is
22  permitted to vote, and thereupon all such candidates for
23  presidential elector shall be credited, in addition, with the
24  votes cast for them upon the ballots deposited in the machine,
25  as hereinabove provided.
26     * * *
27     (b)  In an election district which uses an electronic voting
28  system which utilizes paper ballots or ballot cards to register
29  the votes, the following procedures will be applicable for the
30  conduct of the election at the election district:
1     * * *
2     (4)  If the voter desires to vote for every candidate of a
3  political party or political body, except its candidates for
4  offices as to which he votes for individual candidates in the
5  manner hereinafter provided, he may make a cross (X) or check
6  ( ) or punch or mark sense mark in the square opposite the name
7  of the party or political body so marked, including its
8  candidates for presidential electors, except for those offices
9  as to which he has indicated a choice for individual candidates
10  of the same or another party or political body, by making a
11  cross (X) or check ( ) or punch or mark sense mark opposite
12  their names in the manner hereinabove provided, as to which
13  offices his ballot shall be counted only for the candidates
14  which he has thus individually marked, notwithstanding the fact
15  that he made a mark in the party column, and even though in the
16  case of an office for which more than one candidate is to be
17  voted for, he has not individually marked for such office the
18  full number of candidates for which he is entitled to vote. If
19  he desires to vote for [the entire group of presidential
20  electors nominated by any party or political body] the candidate
21  of one party for presidential elector who is from his
22  congressional district and the two at-large candidates of the
23  same party for presidential elector, he may make a cross (X) or
24  check ( ) or punch or mark sense mark in the appropriate space
25  opposite the names of the candidates for President and Vice-
26  President of such party or body. If he desires to vote a ticket
27  for presidential electors made up of the names of persons
28  nominated by different parties or political bodies, or partially
29  of names of persons so in nomination and partially of names of
30  persons not in nomination by any party or political body, or
1  wholly of names of persons not in nomination by any party or
2  political body, he shall insert the names of the candidates for
3  presidential electors for whom he desires to vote in the blank
4  spaces provided therefor on the write-in ballot under the title
5  of the office "Presidential Electors". In case of a question
6  submitted to the vote of the electors, he may make a cross (X)
7  or check ( ) or punch or mark sense mark in the appropriate
8  square opposite the answer which he desires to give.
