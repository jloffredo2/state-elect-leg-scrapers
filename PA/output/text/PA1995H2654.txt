1  Section 523.1.  Application with college and university student
2                 registration.
3     (a)  General rule.--
4         (1)  The Department of Education shall provide voter
5     registration applications and information to all State-owned
6     institutions and State-related institutions, as defined in
7     section 2 of the act of May 26, 1988 (P.L.448, No.73), known
8     as the College and University Security Information Act. The
9     institution shall inform and provide voter registration
10     applications and information to students upon registration. A
11     registration under this section shall serve as an application
12     to register to vote unless the applicant fails to sign the
13     voter registration application. The Secretary of Education
14     has the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing
15     the student registration/voter registration system created
16     under this section. The secretary, in consultation with the
17     Secretary of Education, may promulgate regulations for
18     implementing this section.
19         (2)  An application for voter registration submitted to
20     the Department of Education under this subsection shall be
21     considered as updating any previous voter registration
22     information by the applicant.
23         (3)  Any change of address submitted to the Department of
24     Education for the purposes of student registration shall
25     serve as notification of change of address for voter
26     registration for the registrant involved unless the
27     registrant indicates that the change of address is not for
28     voter registration purposes.
29     (b)  Process.--
30         (1)  The Department of Education shall provide for an
1     application for voter registration as part of student
2     registration.
3         (2)  The format of the student registration/voter
4     registration application shall be determined and prescribed
5     by the secretary and the Secretary of Education.
6         (3)  The voter registration application portion of the
7     application shall contain all the requirements of an official
8     voter registration application specified in section 527. The
9     voter registration portion of the application:
10             (i)  may not require any information that duplicates
11         information required in the student registration portion
12         of the form, other than a second signature; and
13             (ii)  may require only the minimum amount of
14         information necessary to prevent duplicate voter
15         registration, to enable the registration commission to
16         assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer
17         voter registration and other parts of the election
18         process.
19     (c)  Transmission.--
20         (1)  The Department of Education shall forward completed
21     applications or contents of the completed voter registration
22     applications in machine-readable format to the department.
23         (2)  The department shall transmit the material to the
24     appropriate commission within ten days after the date of its
25     receipt by the Department of Education. If a voter
26     registration application is received by the Department of
27     Education within five days before the last day to register
28     before an election, the application shall be transmitted to
29     the appropriate commission not later than five days after the
30     date of its receipt by the Department of Education.
1         (3)  Upon receipt of the completed voter registration
2     information from the department, the commission shall make a
3     record of the date of the receipt of the application and
4     process the application. No applicant shall be deemed
5     eligible to vote until the commission has received and
6     approved the application.
7         (4)  Changes of address shall comply with the following:
8             (i)  The Department of Education shall notify the
9         secretary of changes of address received under subsection
10         (a)(3). The secretary shall notify the commission of the
11         county of the registrant's prior residence. Except as
12         provided in subparagraph (ii), if the registrant has
13         moved outside of the county, the commission shall forward
14         the registrant's registration card to the commission of
15         the registrant's new county of residence. Except as
16         provided in subparagraph (ii), if the registrant has
17         moved to an address within the commission's jurisdiction,
18         the commission shall update the registration record of
19         the registrant.
20             (ii)  In the case of changes of address received by
21         the Department of Education which do not contain a
22         signature of the registrant, the commission receiving the
23         change of address notification shall mail a notice to the
24         registrant at the new residence address requesting
25         verification of the address change. The verification
26         notice shall be in substantially the following form:

6         Such notices must be sent by first class nonforwardable
7         mail, return postage guaranteed, and must be in a form
8         approved by the secretary and designed in such a manner
9         to allow the registrant to indicate that the address
10         change is incorrect, the reason why such discrepancy
11         exists and to allow for return to the county commission.
12         Such notice must be signed by the registrant and dated.
13             (iii)  If the registrant does not return the notice
14         under subparagraph (ii) within the ten-day period, the
15         commission shall process the change of address according
16         to subparagraph (i). If the registrant notifies the
17         commission that the information is incorrect and the
18         commission is satisfied with the registrant's explanation
19         of the discrepancy, the address of the registrant's
20         registration shall remain unchanged. If the verification
21         notification is returned by the post office, the
22         commission shall direct a confirmation notice to the
23         registrant's address of former residence in accordance
24         with section 1901(d)(2).

3  application made under this section may be used for any purpose
4  other than voter registration.
5     (g)  Staff.--Agents and employees working on behalf of the
6  Department of Education assisting in the completion of voter
7  registration applications shall conduct themselves in a manner
8  consistent with the following principles:

10     political preference or party registration or display
11     political preference or party allegiance.
12         (2)  They shall not make a statement to an applicant or
13     take an action the purpose or effect of which is to
