14     Section 1.  Section 402 of the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333,
15  No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code, amended May 5,
16  1982 (P.L.374, No.108), is amended to read:
17     Section 402.  Qualifications of Election Officers.--
18  [Election] Except as provided in section 405(c), election
19  officers shall be qualified registered electors of the district
20  in which they are elected or appointed. No person shall be
1  qualified to serve as an election officer who shall hold, or
2  shall within two months have held, any office, appointment or
3  employment in or under the Government of the United States or of
4  this State or of any city or county or poor district, of any
5  municipal board, commission or trust in any city, save only

10     Section 2.  Section 405 of the act, repealed in part April
11  28, 1978 (P.L.202, No.53) and amended June 1, 1978 (P.L.456,
12  No.58), is amended to read:
13     Section 405.  Vacancies in Election Boards; Appointment;
14  Judge and Majority Inspector to Be Members of Majority Party;
15  Minority Inspector to Be Member of Minority Party.--(a)
16  Vacancies in election boards existing by reason of the
17  disqualification, removal, resignation or death of an election
18  officer, or from any other cause, occurring prior to [the day
19  of] the fifth day before any primary or election, shall, in all
20  cases, be filled by appointment, by the court of the proper
21  county, of competent persons, qualified in accordance with the
22  provisions of this act, who shall serve for the unexpired term
23  of the person whose place he is appointed to fill: Provided,
24  however, That any district election officer who, after his
25  election or appointment, changes his political affiliation,
26  shall not thereby become disqualified to serve on said election
27  board, and shall not thereby be subject to removal. In making
28  such appointments, the court shall receive and consider any
29  petitions filed by qualified electors of the district affected,
30  and shall make no appointment to fill any vacancy [occurring
1  more than five days before any primary or election,] unless
2  notice of the time at which they will make such appointment
3  shall have been posted on the polling place of such district,
4  and in the immediate vicinity thereof, at least five days prior
5  thereto. In the appointment of inspectors in any election
6  district, both shall not be of the same political party at the
7  time of said appointment, but one shall be of the party having
8  the largest number of votes and the other shall be of the party
9  having the second largest number of votes in said district at
10  the last preceding November election, as nearly as the judge or
11  judges can ascertain the fact. The judge of election shall, in
12  all cases of appointment, be of the political party having the
13  majority of votes in said district at the last preceding
14  November election, as nearly as the judge or judges can
15  ascertain the fact. Immediately upon the entry of an order of
16  court filling any vacancy on an election board, the clerk of
17  said court shall forthwith transmit a certified copy of said
18  order to the county board, giving the name and address of said
19  appointee. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, in
20  counties which have adopted home rule charters or optional plans
21  and which appoint the members of the county election board under
22  section 301(b), vacancies in the county board of elections shall
23  be filled consistent with the provisions for appointment of
24  county election board members under that section.
25     (b)  The first election board for any new district shall be
26  selected, by the court of the proper county, of competent
27  persons, qualified in accordance with the provisions of this
28  act, who shall serve until the next municipal election at which
29  all election officials are elected under the provisions of
30  section 401.
1     (c)  Vacancies in election boards occurring at any time
2  during the five days immediately preceding any primary or
3  election or on the day of the primary or election may be filled
4  by appointment by the county board of elections from a pool of
5  competent persons who are qualified registered electors of the
6  county and who have been trained by the county to perform the
7  duties of election officers which are required by this act. Any
8  person appointed to fill a vacancy in accordance with this
9  subsection shall serve as a member of the election board on the
10  day of the primary or election only. Any election board position
11  filled in accordance with this subsection shall be deemed vacant
12  on the day immediately following the primary or election and
13  subsequently shall be filled in accordance with subsection (a).
14     Section 3.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
