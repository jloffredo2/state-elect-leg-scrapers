15     Section 1.  The act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known
16  as the Pennsylvania Election Code, is amended by adding a
17  section to read:
18     Section 401.1.  Substitutes for Election Officers.--(a)  Each
19  judge, inspector, clerk and machine inspector may designate a
20  substitute who shall serve in his stead for no less than two and
21  no more than eight hours on election day and, during that time,
1  shall perform the duties given to the designating officer by
2  this act. The judge and the county board of elections shall
3  approve the designation of a substitute for an inspector, clerk
4  or machine inspector. The county board of elections shall
5  approve the designation of a substitute for a judge.
6     (b)  The qualifications of substitutes shall be the same as
7  provided for judges, inspectors, clerks and machine inspectors
8  in this act.
9     (c)  A substitute shall receive a pro rata share of the per
10  diem compensation rate fixed by the county board of elections
11  for the designating officer based on the fraction of election
12  day worked by the substitute. The county board of elections
13  shall determine the substitute's share of the officer's
14  compensation and shall make payment directly to the substitute,
15  and the officer shall receive the balance.
16     (d)  No substitute designated under this section shall serve
17  during the opening or closing of the polls.
18     Section 2.  Sections 406 and 413 of the act are amended to
19  read:
20     Section 406.  Election Officers to Be Sworn.--All judges,
21  inspectors, clerks of election [and], machine inspectors and
22  persons serving as their substitutes under section 401.1 shall,
23  before entering upon their duties at any primary or election, be
24  duly sworn in the presence of each other and of the watchers and
25  overseers, if any. The judge shall first be sworn by the
26  minority inspector or by a magistrate, alderman or justice of
27  the peace, and the inspectors, clerks and machine inspectors
28  shall then be sworn by the judge. A substitute shall be sworn by
29  the judge and shall take the same oath as that which is taken by
30  the designating officer. Each of them shall forthwith sign in
1  duplicate the oath taken by him upon forms to be furnished by
2  the county board, and the same shall be attested by the officer
3  who administered the oath.
4     Section 413.  Election Officers, Clerks, Machine Inspectors,
5  Substitutes and Overseers Privileged from Arrest.--District
6  election officers, clerks, machine inspectors, persons serving
7  as substitutes under section 401.1 and overseers shall be
8  privileged from arrest upon days of primaries and elections, and
9  while engaged in making up and transmitting returns, except upon
10  the warrant of a court of record, or judge thereof, for an
11  election fraud, for felony, or for wanton breach of the peace.
12     Section 3.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
