15  (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code,
16  amended December 9, 2002 (P.L.1246, No.150), is amended to read:
17     Section 1210.  Manner of Applying to Vote; Persons Entitled
18  to Vote; Voter's Certificates; Entries to Be Made in District
19  Register; Numbered Lists of Voters; Challenges.--(a)  At every
20  primary and election each elector [who appears to vote in that
21  election district for the first time and] who desires to vote
22  shall first present to an election officer a voter's
1  identification card issued by the county registration commission
2  or any one of the following forms of photo identification:
3     (1)  a valid driver's license or identification card issued
4  by the Department of Transportation;
5     (2)  a valid identification card issued by any other agency
6  of the Commonwealth;
7     (3)  a valid identification card issued by the United States
8  Government;
9     (4)  a valid United States passport;
10     (5)  a valid student identification card;
11     (6)  a valid employe identification card; or
12     (7)  a valid armed forces of the United States identification
13  card.
14  The election officer shall examine the identification presented
15  by the elector.
16     (a.1)  [Where the elector does not have a photo
17  identification as provided for in subsection (a), the elector
18  shall present for examination one of the following forms of
19  identification that shows the name and address of the elector:
20     (1)  nonphoto identification issued by the Commonwealth, or
21  any agency thereof;
22     (2)  nonphoto identification issued by the United States
23  Government, or agency thereof;
24     (3)  a firearm permit;
25     (4)  a current utility bill;
26     (5)  a current bank statement;
27     (6)  a paycheck;
28     (7)  a government check.
29  The election officer shall examine the identification presented
30  by the elector.] If the elector has presented any one of the
1  forms of identification listed in subsection (a) the elector
2  shall subsequently sign a voter's certificate.
3     [(a.2)  If the elector is unable to produce identification or
4  the elector's identification is challenged by the judge of
5  elections, the elector shall be permitted to cast a provisional
6  ballot in accordance with subsection (a.4).]
7     (a.3)  All electors, including any elector that shows
8  identification pursuant to subsection (a), shall subsequently
9  sign a voter's certificate, and, unless he is a State or Federal
10  employe who has registered under any registration act without
11  declaring his residence by street and number, he shall insert
12  his address therein, and hand the same to the election officer
13  in charge of the district register. Such election officer shall
14  thereupon announce the elector's name so that it may be heard by
15  all members of the election board and by all watchers present in
16  the polling place and shall compare the elector's signature on
17  his voter's certificate with his signature in the district
18  register. If, upon such comparison, the signature upon the
19  voter's certificate appears to be genuine, the elector who has
20  signed the certificate shall, if otherwise qualified, be
21  permitted to vote: Provided, That if the signature on the
22  voter's certificate, as compared with the signature as recorded
23  in the district register, shall not be deemed authentic by any
24  of the election officers, such elector shall not be denied the
25  right to vote for that reason, but shall be considered
26  challenged as to identity and required to make the affidavit and
27  produce the evidence as provided in subsection (d) of this
28  section. When an elector has been found entitled to vote, the
29  election officer who examined his voter's certificate and
30  compared his signature shall sign his name or initials on the
1  voter's certificate, shall, if the elector's signature is not
2  readily legible, print such elector's name over his signature,
3  and the number of the stub of the ballot issued to him or his
4  number in the order of admission to the voting machines, and at
5  primaries a letter or abbreviation designating the party in
6  whose primary he votes shall also be entered by one of the
7  election officers or clerks. As each voter is found to be
8  qualified and votes, the election officer in charge of the
9  district register shall write or stamp the date of the election
10  or primary, the number of the stub of the ballot issued to him
11  or his number in the order of admission to the voting machines,
12  and at primaries a letter or abbreviation designating the party
13  in whose primary he votes, and shall sign his name or initials
14  in the proper space on the registration card of such voter
15  contained in the district register.
16     As each voter votes, his name in the order of voting shall be
17  recorded in two (2) numbered lists of voters provided for that
18  purpose, with the addition of a note of each voter's party
19  enrollment after his name at primaries.
20     (a.4)  (1)  At all elections an individual who claims to be
21  properly registered and eligible to vote at the election
22  district but whose name does not appear on the general register
23  and whose registration cannot be determined by the inspectors of
24  election or the county election board shall be permitted to cast
25  a provisional ballot. Individuals who are voting for the first
26  time at the election district shall be required to produce
27  identification pursuant to subsection (a) or (a.1) and if unable
28  to do so shall be permitted to cast a provisional ballot. An
29  individual presenting a judicial order to vote shall be
30  permitted to cast a provisional ballot.
1     (2)  Prior to voting the provisional ballot, the elector shall
2  be required to sign an affidavit stating the following:
3                I do solemnly swear or affirm that my
4  name is _____________, that my date of birth is ___________,
5  and at the time that I registered I resided at _______________in
6  the municipality of ______________ in _____________ County of
7  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and that this is the only
8  ballot that I cast in this election.
9  Signature of Voter/Elector
10  Current Address
11  Signed by Judge of Elections and minority inspector
12     (3)  After the provisional ballot has been cast, the
13  individual shall place it in a secrecy envelope. The individual
14  shall place the secrecy envelope in the provisional ballot
15  envelope and shall place his signature on the front of the
16  provisional ballot envelope. All provisional ballots shall
17  remain sealed in their provisional ballot envelopes for return
18  to the county board of elections.
19     (4)  Within three business days of the election, the county
20  board of elections shall examine each provisional ballot
21  envelope to determine if the individual voting that ballot was
22  entitled to vote at the election district in the election. One
23  authorized representative of each candidate in a primary or
24  election, who is an elector in the county, shall be permitted to
25  remain in the room in which the determination is being made if
26  he does not impede the orderly conduct of the determination.
27     (5)  If it is determined that the individual was registered
28  and entitled to vote at the election district where the ballot
1  was cast, the county board of elections shall compare the
2  signature on the provisional ballot envelope with the signature
3  on the elector's registration form and, if the signatures are
4  determined to be genuine, count the ballot.
5     (6)  If it is determined that the individual voting the
6  provisional ballot was not registered, the provisional ballot
7  shall not be counted and the ballot shall remain in the
8  provisional ballot envelope and shall be marked "Rejected as
9  Ineligible."
10     (7)  If it is determined that the individual voting the
11  provisional ballot was eligible to vote but not at the election
12  district where the ballot was cast, the county board of
13  elections shall open the envelope and only count that portion of
14  the ballot that the individual would have been eligible to vote
15  in his proper election district and at the election district
16  where the vote was cast.
17     (8)  The department shall establish a World Wide Web site and
18  a toll-free telephone number to permit an individual who cast a
19  provisional ballot to determine whether the vote of that
20  individual was counted and, if the vote was not counted, the
21  reason that it was not counted.
22     (9)  For purposes of this subsection, "provisional ballot"
23  means a ballot issued to an individual who claims to be a
24  registered elector by the judge of elections on election day
25  when the individual's name does not appear on the general
26  register and the individual's registration cannot be verified.
27     (b)  If any elector was unable to sign his name at the time
28  of registration, or, if having been able to sign his name when
29  registered, he subsequently shall have lost his sight or lost
30  the hand with which he was accustomed to sign his name, or shall
1  have been otherwise rendered by disease or accident unable to
2  sign his name when he applies to vote, he shall establish his
3  identity to the satisfaction of the election officers, and in
4  such case he shall not be required to sign a voter's
5  certificate, but a certificate shall be prepared for him by one
6  of the election officers, upon which the facts as to such
7  disability shall be noted and attested by the signature of such
8  election officer.
9     (c)  No person who applies to vote shall be permitted by any
10  election officer or clerk or other person to see the signature
11  recorded as his in the district register until after he shall
12  have signed his name to the voter's certificate.
13     (d)  No person, except a qualified elector who is in actual
14  military or naval service under a requisition of the President
15  of the United States or by the authority of this Commonwealth,
16  and who votes under the provisions of Article XIII of this act,
17  shall be entitled or permitted to vote at any primary or
18  election at any polling place outside the election district in
19  which he resides, nor shall he be permitted to vote in the
20  election district in which he resides, unless he has been
21  personally registered as an elector and his registration card
22  appears in the district register of such election district,
23  except by order of the court of common pleas as provided in this
24  act, and any person, although personally registered as an
25  elector, may be challenged by any qualified elector, election
26  officer, overseer, or watcher at any primary or election as to
27  his identity, as to his continued residence in the election
28  district or as to any alleged violation of the provisions of
29  section 1210 of this act, and if challenged as to identity or
30  residence, he shall produce at least one qualified elector of
1  the election district as a witness, who shall make affidavit of
2  his identity or continued residence in the election district:
3  Provided, however, That no person shall be entitled to vote as a
4  member of a party at any primary, unless he is registered and
5  enrolled as a member of such party upon the district register,
6  which enrollment shall be conclusive as to his party membership
7  and shall not be subject to challenge on the day of the primary.
8     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
