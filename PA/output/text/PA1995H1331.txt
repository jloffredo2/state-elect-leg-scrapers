22     Section 1305.  Approval of Application for Absentee Ballot.--
23     (a)  The county board of elections, upon receipt of an
24  application filed by a qualified elector who is entitled to an
25  absentee ballot under section 1301, shall ascertain from the
26  information on the application, district register or from any
27  other source that the applicant possesses all the qualifications
28  of a qualified elector. If the board is satisfied that the
29  applicant is qualified to receive an official absentee ballot,
30  the application shall be marked approved. The approval decision
1  shall be final and binding except that challenges may be made
2  only on the ground that the applicant did not possess
3  qualifications of an absentee elector. Challenges must be made
4  to the county board of elections prior to 5 o'clock P.M. on the
5  first Friday prior to the election. When so approved, the county
6  board of elections shall cause the applicant's name and
7  residence (and at a primary, the party enrollment) to be
8  inserted in the Military, Veterans and Emergency Civilians
9  Absentee Voters File as provided in subsection (b) of section
10  1306. However, no application of any qualified elector in
11  military service shall be rejected for failure to include on the
12  application any information if the information may be
13  ascertained within a reasonable time by the county board of
14  elections.
15     (b)  The duties of the county boards of elections and the
16  registration commissions with respect to the insertion of the
17  absentee voter's temporary registration card of any elector from
18  the district register as set forth in this section shall include
19  only the applications and emergency applications as are received
20  on or before the first Tuesday prior to the election. In all
21  cases where applications are received after the first Tuesday
22  prior to the election and before 5 o'clock P.M. on the first
23  Friday prior to the election, the county board of elections
24  shall determine the qualifications of the applicant by comparing
25  the information set forth on the application with the
26  information contained on the applicant's duplicate registration
27  card on file in the General Register (also referred to as the
28  Master File) in the office of the registration commission and
29  shall cause the name and residence (and at primaries, the party
30  enrollment) to be inserted in the Military, Veterans and
1  Emergency Civilian Absentee Voters File as provided in
2  subsection (b) of section 1306. In addition, the local district
3  boards of elections shall, upon canvassing the official absentee
4  ballots under section 1315, examine the voting check list of the
5  election district of the elector's residence and satisfy itself
6  that the elector did not cast any ballot other than the one
7  properly issued under the absentee ballot application. In all
8  cases where the examination of the local district board of
9  elections discloses that an elector did vote a ballot other than
10  the one properly issued under the absentee ballot application,
11  the local district board of elections shall thereupon cancel the
12  absentee ballot and the elector shall be subject to the
13  penalties as set forth under this act.
14     (c)  In the event that any application for an official
15  absentee ballot is not approved by the county board of
16  elections, the elector shall be notified immediately to that
17  effect with a statement by the county board of the reasons for
18  the disapproval. If an application is rejected because it is
19  incomplete, a copy of the original application shall be
20  maintained by the county board.
21     (d)  The absentee voter's temporary registration card shall
22  be in duplicate and the same size as the permanent registration
23  card, in a different and contrasting color to the permanent
24  registration card, and shall contain the absentee voter's name
25  and address and shall conspicuously contain the words "Absentee
26  Voter." The card shall also contain the affidavit required by
27  subsection (a) of section 1313.

29     (a)  The county board of elections shall maintain at its
30  office a file containing the duplicate absentee voter's

14  the official ballots for absentee electors shall be required to
15  indicate on the stub of each ballot so detached the name of the

23  those districts in which paper ballots are used and the county
24  board of elections therein do not print official absentee
25  ballots in accordance with sections 1002 and 1003, the ballots
26  for use by such absentee electors under the provisions of this
27  act shall be prepared sufficiently in advance by the county
28  board of elections and shall be distributed by the boards as
29  provided under this act. Ballots shall be marked Official

1  in substantially the form for ballots required by Article X of
2  this act which form shall be determined and prescribed by the
3  Secretary of the Commonwealth.

5  utilized, the absentee ballot may be in the form of a ballot
6  card which shall be clearly stamped on its face "Absentee
7  Ballot."

12  ballots except that the special write-in absentee ballots shall
13  contain blank spaces only under the titles of the offices in

15  they desire to vote, and in these cases the county board of
16  elections shall furnish to electors lists containing the names
17  of all the candidates named in nomination petitions or who have
18  been regularly nominated under the provisions of this act, for
19  the use of the electors in preparing their ballots. Special
20  write-in absentee ballots also shall include all constitutional
21  amendments and other questions to be voted on by the electors.
22     (e)  The official absentee voter ballot shall state that a
23  voter who receives an absentee ballot pursuant to section 1301
24  and who, on election day, is capable of voting at the
25  appropriate polling place must void the absentee ballot and vote
26  in the normal manner at the appropriate voting place.

12  place because of illness or physical disability, entitled to
13  vote an official absentee ballot shall be in the county of his
14  residence on the day for holding the election for which the
15  ballot was issued, or in the event any elector shall have

25  first presented himself to the judge of election in his local
26  election district and shall have signed the affidavit on the
27  absentee voter's temporary registration card, which affidavit
28  shall be in substantially the following form:
29     I hereby swear that I am a qualified registered elector who

4     (a)  Whenever any qualified elector in actual military
5  service is present in the voting district of residence on any
6  primary, special, municipal or general election day and has not
7  already voted in the election, the elector may apply in person

3     Section 1315.  Canvassing of Official Absentee Ballots.--
4     (a)  The county boards of elections, upon receipt of official

6  keep the same in sealed or locked containers. No absentee ballot
7  which is received by the county board of elections later than 2
8  o'clock P.M. on the Monday immediately preceding the election
9  may be counted.
10     (b)  No later than 4 o'clock P.M. on Monday prior to any
11  election the county board of elections shall prepare an
12  alphabetical list containing the names and addresses of all
13  electors who have submitted an absentee ballot in each election
14  district. The list shall be known as the Absentee Ballot Return
15  List. The Absentee Ballot Return List shall be made available
16  for public inspection and copying. Ballots returned by electors
17  defined in subsection (a)(1) of section 1301 and in the
18  emergency provisions contained in subsection (b) of section 1304
19  shall be added to the list as practicable.
20     (c)  The Absentee Ballot Return List shall be distributed to
21  each election district prior to the opening of the polls on
22  election day. The list shall be posted in a conspicuous place in
23  each election district.
24     (d)  The county board of elections may distribute the
25  unopened absentee ballots to the local election district
26  concurrently with the distribution of other election supplies.
27  However, the absentee ballots shall remain in a separate sealed
28  container bearing the following notice printed in boldface type:
29                          ABSENTEE BALLOT
30         The law prohibits the opening of any absentee ballot
1         prior to the closing of the polls. Any challenged ballot
2         shall not be opened but shall be returned to the county
3         board of elections. Any person violating this provision
4         of law shall be guilty of a criminal offense subject to a
5         minimum mandatory fine of two hundred fifty dollars
6         ($250) per ballot.
7     The notice required by this subsection shall be in both
8  English and Spanish where deemed appropriate by the Secretary of
9  the Commonwealth.
10     In no case shall the absentee ballots be distributed later
11  than 6 o'clock P.M. on election day. The absentee ballot
12  container shall be signed for by the judge of election in the
13  manner prescribed for ballots and other supplies in section
14  1204.
15     (e)  Absentee ballots shall be opened and canvassed in each
16  election district without interruption immediately upon the
17  closing of the polls and prior to the canvassing of other
18  ballots.
19     (f)  Poll watchers, each candidate, each candidate's attorney
20  and each candidate's authorized representative shall be
21  permitted to be present when the envelopes containing official
22  absentee ballots are opened and canvassed. The results of the
23  canvassing of the absentee ballots shall be included in the
24  tally of all votes and returned to the county board of elections
25  with the returns of that district.
26     (g)  (1)  In the event that an electronic voting system
27  provides for central tabulations of ballots, absentee ballots
28  shall be opened and deposited in the ballot box without being
29  counted except as to the number of absentee ballots cast. The
30  absentee ballots shall be counted along with the other ballots
1  from the election district at the location and in the manner
2  specified by the county board of elections and provided for by
3  the electronic voting system utilized.
4     (2)  In the event that an electronic voting system provides
5  for tabulation of votes at the election district, the absentee
6  ballots shall be opened, checked for write-in votes in
7  accordance with section 1113-A and then either hand-counted or
8  counted by means of the automatic tabulation equipment, whatever
9  the case may be.
10     (h)  Whenever it shall appear by due proof that any absentee
11  elector who has returned a ballot in accordance with the
12  provisions of this act has died prior to the opening of the
13  polls on the day of the election, the ballot of the deceased
14  elector shall be rejected by the canvassers but the counting of
15  the ballot of an elector thus deceased shall not of itself
16  invalidate any nomination or election.
17     (i)  The local election board shall then further examine the
18  declaration on each envelope not so set aside and shall compare
19  the information thereon with that contained in the Registered
20  Absentee Voters File, the Absentee Voter Application List, the
21  Absentee Ballot Return List, the absentee voters' list and the
22  Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters File.
23  The local election board shall determine that the declaration is
24  sufficient and shall verify the elector's right to vote.
25     Section 1316.  Absentee Ballot Challenges.--
26     (a)  At any time on election day, a poll watcher, candidate,
27  candidate's attorney or candidate's authorized representative
28  may challenge the ballot of any absentee elector for any of the
29  following reasons:
30     (1)  The absentee elector is not a qualified elector;
1     (2)  The absentee elector was within the county of his
2  residence on the day of the election during the period the polls
3  were open, except where he was in military service or was unable
4  to appear personally at the polling place because of illness or
5  physical disability; or
6     (3)  The absentee elector was able to appear personally at
7  the polling place on the day of the election during the period
8  the polls were open and the ballot was obtained for the reason
9  that he was unable to appear personally at the polling place
10  because of illness or physical disability.
11     (b)  Any challenge made pursuant to subsection (a) shall be
12  made to and recorded by the judge of election on the Absentee
13  Ballot Return List together with the reason or reasons therefor.
14  Upon the close of the polls, the judge of election shall unseal
15  the absentee ballot container and mark "Challenged" on the
16  envelope of each challenged ballot with the reason or reasons
17  therefor and the same shall be set aside for return to the
18  county board of elections unopened. Challenged ballots shall not
19  be counted nor included in the tally of votes returned to the
20  county board of elections with the returns of the election
21  district.
22     (c)  The local election board shall announce the names of the
23  electors on all remaining unchallenged ballots and shall give
24  any watcher, candidate, candidate's attorney and candidate's
25  authorized representative present an opportunity to challenge
26  any absentee elector for any of the reasons set forth in
27  subsection (a).
28     (d)  Any person challenging an application for an absentee
29  ballot or an absentee ballot shall deposit the sum of ten

2  challenges made to the county for which the person shall be
3  issued a receipt for each challenge made, not to exceed a total
4  of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for all
5  challenges. All deposits received pursuant to this subsection
6  shall be refunded if the challenge is sustained or if the
7  challenge is withdrawn within five days after the election. If
8  the challenge is dismissed by any lawful order, then the deposit
9  shall be forfeited. All deposit money received by the local
10  election board shall be turned over to the county board of
11  elections simultaneously with the return of the challenged
12  ballots. The county board shall deposit all deposit money in the
13  general fund of the county.
14     (e)  All absentee ballots not challenged for any of the
15  reasons under subsection (a) shall be counted and included with
16  the general return of paper ballots or voting machines.
17     (f)  Challenged ballots shall be returned to the county board
18  of elections with the returns of the local election district and
19  placed unopened in a secure, safe and sealed container in the
20  custody of the county board until a hearing on the challenge is
21  held.
22     (g)  For purposes of this section, authorization to act as a
23  candidate's representative shall be in writing, signed by the
24  candidate and filed with the judge of elections for
25  recordkeeping purposes.
26     Section 1317.  Impoundment.--
27     (a)  At any time prior to 4 o'clock P.M. on election day, the
28  candidate or the candidate's attorney may petition the court of
29  common pleas of the county to impound all completed absentee
30  ballots received by the county board of elections from specified
1  districts.
2     (b)  In order to file a petition to impound, a fee of ten
3  dollars ($10) per ballot, with a minimum of one thousand dollars
4  ($1,000) and a maximum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) in
5  cash, as determined by the court, shall be deposited with the
6  court. The fee shall be refunded if the court determines,
7  following review of the absentee ballots by the county board of
8  elections, that the action was not frivolous.
9     (c)  The court shall not be bound by technical rules of
10  evidence, including rules regarding hearsay. The court shall
11  advise all witnesses of the provisions of section 8 of Article
12  VII of the Constitution of Pennsylvania.
13     (d)  If the court determines that the evidence presented
14  indicates a pattern of unlawful absentee voting, the court shall
15  temporarily impound all absentee ballots received by the county
16  board of elections from specified districts pending an order to
17  the county board of elections to conduct a full review of all
18  ballots in accordance with section 1319. The court shall have
19  the discretion to determine if a pattern of unlawful absentee
20  voting exists; however, twenty-five (25) or more illegally cast
21  absentee ballots shall constitute a pattern of unlawful absentee
22  voting for purposes of impoundment.
23     Section 1318.  Canvassing Unchallenged Absentee Ballots.--
24     (a)  The local election board shall open the envelope of
25  every unchallenged absentee elector in a manner as not to
26  destroy the declaration executed thereon. All of the envelopes
27  on which are printed, stamped or endorsed the words "Official
28  Absentee Ballot" shall be placed in one or more depositories at
29  one time and the depository or depositories well shaken and the
30  envelopes mixed before any envelope is taken therefrom.
1     (b)  If any of these envelopes shall contain any extraneous
2  marks or identifying symbols other than the words "Official
3  Absentee Ballot," the envelopes and the ballots contained
4  therein shall be set aside and declared void.
5     (c)  The local election board shall then break the seals of
6  the envelopes, remove the ballots and record the votes in the
7  same manner as district election officers are required to record
8  votes.
9     Section 1319.  County Board of Elections Challenge
10  Procedures.--
11     (a)  The county board of elections shall fix a time and place
12  for a formal hearing of all challenges and notice shall be given
13  where possible to all absentee electors thus challenged and to
14  every watcher, candidate, candidate's attorney or candidate's
15  authorized representative who made a challenge.
16     (b)  The time for the hearing shall be no sooner than two
17  days, but shall not be later than seven days after the date of
18  the challenge. On the day fixed for the hearing, the county
19  board shall proceed without delay to hear challenges.
20     (c)  The county board of elections shall not be bound by
21  technical rules of evidence, including rules regarding hearsay.
22  The county board of elections shall advise all witnesses and
23  participants of the provisions of section 8 of Article VII of
24  the Constitution of Pennsylvania. The board shall hear witnesses
25  presented for each individual challenged ballot and evidence of
26  fraud or illegal activity, whether discovered before or after
27  the election.
28     (d)  The testimony presented shall be stenographically
29  recorded and made part of the record of the hearing.
30     (e)  The decision of the county board of elections in
1  upholding or dismissing any challenge shall be in writing and
2  may be reviewed by the court of common pleas of the county upon
3  a petition filed by any person aggrieved by the decision of the
4  county board. The appeal must be taken to the court of common
5  pleas no later than two business days after the decision of the
6  board, with the petition setting forth the objections to the
7  county board's decision.
8     (f)  No certification of the results of the election by the
9  county board may occur during the two-day appeal period. If an
10  appeal is taken, no certification of the results of the
11  challenged election may occur until the resolution of all
12  appeals or six months from the date of the election, whichever
13  is sooner. However, a court having jurisdiction over an appeal
14  of the decision of the county board may order the certification
15  of the election if it determines that the fraud or other
16  improper conduct or procedure alleged could not have altered the
17  outcome of the election. Following such certification, the
18  appeal may continue as to the fraud or other improper conduct or
19  procedure.
20     (g)  Upon the resolution of all appeals or six months from
21  the date of the election, the county board of elections shall
22  complete the computation of the returns for the challenged
23  election. The votes cast upon the challenged official absentee
24  ballots which are upheld shall be added to the other votes cast
25  within the county.
26     (h)  In hearing an appeal under this article, the court shall
27  not be bound by the technical rules of evidence, including rules
28  regarding hearsay. The court shall advise all witnesses of the
29  provisions of section 8 of Article VII of the Constitution of
30  Pennsylvania. The court shall admit evidence of fraud or illegal
1  activity, whether discovered before or after the election.
2     (i)  The courts of the Commonwealth shall expedite all
3  appeals which come before them under this article.
4     Section 1320.  Public Records.--All official absentee
5  ballots, files, applications for absentee ballots and envelopes
6  on which the executed declarations appear, and all information
7  and lists are hereby designated and declared to be public
8  records. All such public records shall be maintained for a
9  period of five years. No candidate or other elector shall be
10  denied access to any public record within the meaning of this
11  section. No information concerning a military elector shall be
12  made public which is expressly forbidden by the Department of
13  Defense.
14     Section 3.  Section 1404(f) of the act is amended and the
15  section is amended by adding a subsection to read:
16     Section 1404.  Computation of Returns by County Board;
17  Certification; Issuance of Certificates of Election.--
18     * * *
19     (f)  As the returns from each election district are read,
20  computed and found to be correct or corrected as aforesaid, they
21  shall be recorded on the blanks prepared for the purpose until
22  all the returns from the various election districts which are
23  entitled to be counted shall have been duly recorded, when they
24  shall be added together, announced and attested by the clerks
25  who made and computed the entries respectively and signed by the
26  members of the county board. At the expiration of five days
27  after the completion of the computation of votes, in case no
28  petition for a recount or recanvass has been filed in accordance
29  with the provisions of this act, [or upon the completion of the
30  recount or recanvass if a petition therefor has been filed
1  within five days after the completion of the computation of
2  votes,] the county board shall certify the returns so computed
3  in said county in the manner required by this act, unless upon
4  appeals taken from any decision, the court of common pleas shall
5  have directed any returns to be revised, or unless in case of a
6  recount, errors in the said returns shall have been found, in
7  which case said returns shall be revised, corrected and
8  certified accordingly. The county board shall thereupon, in the
9  case of elections, issue certificates of election to the
10  successful candidates for all county, city, borough, township,
11  ward, school district, poor district and election offices, and
12  local party offices to be filled by the votes of the electors of
13  said county, or of any part thereof.
14     (g)  In the event of any recount, recanvass or other
15  challenge based on fraud or any other violation of this act, the
16  board shall not certify the election for a period of two
17  business days following its determination or ruling on the
18  matter. A decision of the county board of elections may be taken
19  to the court of common pleas of the county within two business
20  days after the decision of the board. If an appeal is taken, no
21  certification of the results of the challenged election may
22  occur until the resolution of all appeals or until the
23  expiration of six months from the date of the election,
24  whichever is sooner. The courts of this Commonwealth shall
25  expedite all appeals and other matters which come before them
26  pursuant to this act.
27     Section 4.  Section 1407 of the act, repealed in part April
28  28, 1978 (P.L.202, No.53), is amended to read:
29     Section 1407.  Appeals to Court from Decisions of the County
30  Board.--
1     (a)  Any person aggrieved by any order or decision of any
2  county board regarding the computation or canvassing of the
3  returns of any primary or election, or regarding any recount or
4  recanvass thereof under sections 1701, 1702 and 1703 of this
5  act, may appeal therefrom within two days after such order or
6  decision shall have been made, whether then reduced to writing
7  or not, to the court of common pleas of the proper county,
8  setting forth why he feels that an injustice has been done, and
9  praying for such order as will give him relief. Upon the payment
10  to the prothonotary of a fee for filing such appeal, a judge of
11  the court shall fix a time and place for hearing the matter in
12  dispute within three days thereafter, of which due notice shall
13  be served, with a copy of such appeal, by the appellant upon a
14  member of the county board whose action is complained of and
15  upon every attorney, watcher or candidate who opposed the
16  contention of the appellant before the county board, and upon
17  any other person that the judge shall direct, at least two days
18  before the matter shall be reviewed by the court. Proof of such
19  notice or the waiver thereof must be filed therein before any
20  appeal is sustained.
21     (b)  [The] A court [on an] hearing any action or appeal
22  regarding any election shall have full and broad power and
23  authority to hear and determine all matters pertaining to any
24  fraud [or], error or other act which violates the election laws
25  of this Commonwealth committed in any election district [to
26  which such appeal relates,] and to make such order or decree [as
27  right and justice may require.] to create a fair and just
28  resolution. An order under this subsection may include, but
29  shall not be limited to, a recount, the voiding of improperly
30  cast ballots, an award of damages or a new election. Pending
1  [such] an appeal[, the] of the decision of a county board, the
2  board shall suspend any official certification of the votes cast
3  in such election district, in accordance with section 1319(f)
4  and (g). None of the orders or decisions of either the county
5  board or [the] any court [of common pleas] on appeal shall be
6  deemed a final adjudication regarding the results of any
7  [primary or] election, so as to preclude any contest thereof.
8  [No appeal shall be allowed or granted from any order or decree
9  of the court of common pleas made in pursuance of this section.]
10  The court of common pleas, upon any appeal under this section,
11  may compel the appellant or any opposing party, other than the
12  county board, to pay all the witness fees, if any, or other
13  legal costs of the hearing, which costs may be taxed by the
14  prothonotary in the usual manner.
15     Section 5.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
