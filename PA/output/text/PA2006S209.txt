12  an immediate family member of the elector to said county board
13  of election:
14     Provided, however, That any elector, spouse of the elector or

26  and is unable to sign his declaration because of illness or
27  physical disability, shall be excused from signing upon making a
28  declaration which shall be witnessed by one adult person in
29  substantially the following form: I hereby declare that I am
30  unable to sign my declaration for voting my absentee ballot
1  without assistance because I am unable to write by reason of my
2  illness or physical disability. I have made or received
3  assistance in making my mark in lieu of my signature.

13  place because of illness or physical disability, entitled to
14  vote an official absentee ballot shall be in the municipality of
15  his residence on the day for holding the primary or election for
16  which the ballot was issued, or in the event any such elector
17  shall have recovered from his illness or physical disability
18  sufficiently to permit him to present himself at the proper
19  polling place for the purpose of casting his ballot, such
20  absentee ballot cast by such elector shall, be declared void.
21     Any such elector referred to in this subsection, who is
22  within the municipality of his residence, must present himself
23  at his polling place and shall be permitted to vote upon
24  presenting himself at his regular polling place in the same
25  manner as he could have voted had he not received an absentee
26  ballot: Provided, That such elector has first presented himself
27  to the judge of elections in his local election district and
28  shall have signed the affidavit on the absentee voter's
29  temporary registration card, which affidavit shall be in
30  substantially the following form:
1     I hereby swear that I am a qualified registered elector who
2  has obtained an absentee ballot, however, I am present in the
3  municipality of my residence and physically able to present
4  myself at my polling place and therefore request that my
5  absentee ballot be voided.

9       (Local Judge of Elections)
10     An elector who has received an absentee ballot under the
11  emergency application provisions of section 1302.1, and for
12  whom, therefore, no temporary absentee voter's registration card
13  is in the district register, shall sign the aforementioned
14  affidavit in any case, which the local judge of elections shall
15  then cause to be inserted in the district register with the
16  elector's permanent registration card.
17     (c) As used in this section, "immediate family member" means
18  an adult who is a spouse, parent, child, grandparent, grandchild
19  or sibling of an elector, whether by adoption or natural
20  relationship. The term includes an adult occupant regularly
21  living with an elector.
22     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
