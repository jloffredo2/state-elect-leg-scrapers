28  sufficiently to permit him to present himself at the proper
29  polling place for the purpose of casting his ballot, such
30  absentee ballot cast by such elector shall, be declared void.
1     Any such elector referred to in this subsection, who is
2  within the municipality of his residence, must present himself
3  at his polling place and shall be permitted to vote upon
4  presenting himself at his regular polling place in the same
5  manner as he could have voted had he not received an absentee
6  ballot: Provided, That such elector has first presented himself
7  to the judge of elections in his local election district and

9  temporary registration card, which affidavit shall be in
10  substantially the following form:
11     I hereby swear that I am a qualified registered elector who
12  has obtained an absentee ballot, however, I am present in the
13  municipality of my residence and physically able to present
14  myself at my polling place and therefore request that my
15  absentee ballot be voided.

20     An elector who has received an absentee ballot under the

22  whom, therefore, no temporary absentee voter's registration card
23  is in the district register, shall sign the aforementioned
24  affidavit in any case, which the local judge of elections shall
25  then cause to be inserted in the district register with the
26  elector's permanent registration card.
27     Section 4.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
