18     Section 1003.  Form of Official Election Ballot.--
19     (a)  (1)  The official ballots for general, municipal and
20  special elections shall be in substantially the following form:
21                          OFFICIAL BALLOT

1  County of ................., State of Pennsylvania ............
2  Election held on the ..... day of .........., 19.. A cross (X)
3  or check ( ) mark in the square opposite the name of any
4  candidate indicates a vote for that candidate.
5     (2)  [To vote a straight party ticket, mark a cross (X) or
6  check ( ) in the square, in the Party Column, opposite the name
7  of the party of your choice.] To vote for an individual
8  candidate [of another party after making a mark in the party
9  square], mark a cross (X) or check ( ) opposite his name. For an
10  office where more than one candidate is to be voted for, the
11  voter, after marking in the party square, may divide his vote by
12  marking a cross (X) or check ( ) to the right of each candidate
13  for whom he or she desires to vote. For such office votes shall
14  not be counted for candidates not individually marked.
15     (3)  To vote for a person whose name is not on the ballot,
16  write, print or paste his name in the blank space provided for
17  that purpose. A cross (X) or check ( ) mark in the square
18  opposite the names of the candidates of any party for President
19  and Vice-President of the United States indicates a vote for all
20  the candidates of that party for presidential elector. To vote
21  for individual candidates for presidential elector, write, print
22  or paste their names in the blank spaces provided for that
23  purpose under the title "Presidential Electors." Mark ballot
24  only in black lead pencil, indelible pencil or blue, black or
25  blue-black ink, in fountain pen or ball point pen; use the same
26  pencil or pen for all markings you place on the ballot.
27     (4)  Before leaving the voting compartment, fold this ballot,
28  without displaying the markings thereon, in the same way it was
29  folded when received, then leave the compartment and exhibit the
30  ballot to one of the election officers who shall ascertain by an
1  inspection of the number appearing upon the right hand corner of
2  the back of the ballot whether the ballot so exhibited to him is
3  the same ballot which the elector received before entering the
4  voting compartment. If it is the same, the election officer
5  shall direct the elector, without unfolding the ballot, to
6  remove the perforated corner containing the number, and the
7  elector shall immediately deposit the ballot in the ballot box.
8  Any ballot deposited in a ballot box at any primary or election
9  without having the said number torn off shall be void and shall
10  not be counted.

29  April 24, 1947 (P.L.68, No.33) and December 22, 1971 (P.L.613,
30  No.165), are amended to read:
1     Section 1110.  Form of Ballot Labels on Voting Machines.--
2     (a)  The papers, cards or strips, enclosed within the ballot
3  frame or frames of any voting machine, and containing the names
4  of a candidate or candidates, [or political party,] or the
5  statement of a question to be voted upon, hereinafter referred
6  to as ballot labels, shall be printed in black ink, upon clear
7  white material, of such size as will fit the ballot frame, and
8  in plain clear type so as to be easily readable by persons with
9  normal vision.
10     (b)  If the construction of the machine shall require it, the
11  ballot label for each candidate, group of candidates, [political
12  party,] or question, to be voted on, shall bear the designating
13  letter or number of the counter on the voting machine which will
14  register or record votes therefor. Each question to be voted on
15  shall appear on the ballot labels, in brief form, of not more
16  than seventy-five words, to be determined by the Secretary of
17  the Commonwealth in the case of constitutional amendments or
18  other questions to be voted on by the electors of the State at

20     * * *
21     (h)  The names of all candidates of a political party shall

6  arranged under or opposite the title of the office for which
7  they are candidates, and shall appear in the order of the votes
8  obtained by the candidate for Governor of the party nominated at
9  the last gubernatorial election, beginning with the party
10  obtaining the highest number of votes: Provided, however, That
11  in the case of parties or bodies not represented on the ballot
12  at the last gubernatorial election, the names of the candidates
13  of such parties shall be arranged alphabetically, according to
14  the party or body name. The names of all candidates of a
15  political body shall appear in the same row or column, and, if
16  the number of parties and bodies permits, each political body
17  shall be entitled exclusively to a separate row or column[, with
18  a straight party lever]. If, however, the number of political
19  parties and political bodies renders it impossible or
20  impracticable to so arrange the political bodies, in such case
21  said bodies shall not be entitled to a separate row or column
22  [and a straight party lever], but shall be listed by political
23  appellations on the first left hand or top row, with the
24  designating letter and number of the ballot label where their
25  candidates may be found, together with the political
26  appellations of other political bodies, whose candidates may be
27  interspersed on the same row or column. Subject to the aforesaid
28  limitations, the form and arrangement of ballot labels, as to
29  the placing thereon of political bodies, shall be within the
30  discretion of the county board.

20  candidates for presidential electors, except with respect to
21  those offices as to which the voter has registered a vote for

17  may vote a straight political party ticket in one operation by
18  operating the straight political party lever of the political
19  party or political body of his choice, if such machine has
20  thereon a separate lever for all the candidates of the political
21  body]. He may also, [after having operated the straight party
22  lever, and] before recording his vote, cancel the vote for any
23  candidate [of such political party or political body] by
24  replacing the individual key, handle, pointer or knob of such

3     Section 7.  Section 1222 of the act, amended July 14, 1961
4  (P.L.644, No.332), is amended to read:
5     Section 1222.  Count and Return of Votes in Districts in
6  Which Ballots are Used.--
7     (a) As soon as all the ballots have been properly accounted
8  for, and those outside the ballot box, as well as the "Voting
9  Check List," numbered lists of voters and district register
10  sealed, the election officers shall forthwith open the ballot
11  box, and take therefrom all ballots therein, and at primaries,
12  separate the same according to the party to which they belong.
13  The ballots shall then be counted one by one, and a record made
14  of the total number, and at primaries of the total number cast
15  for each party. Then the judge, under the scrutiny of the
16  minority inspector, or the minority inspector, under the
17  scrutiny of the judge, in the presence of the other officers,
18  clerks, and of the overseers, if any, and within the hearing and
19  sight of the watchers outside the enclosed space, shall read
20  aloud the names of the candidates marked or inserted upon each
21  ballot (at primaries the ballots of each party being read in
22  sequence), together with the office for which the person named
23  is a candidate, and the answers contained on the ballots to the
24  questions submitted, if any, and the majority inspector and
25  clerks shall carefully enter each vote as read, and keep account
26  of the same in ink in triplicate tally papers (triplicate tally
27  papers for each party at primaries) to be provided by the county
28  board of elections for that purpose, all three of which shall be
29  made at the same time[: Provided, That at all general, municipal
30  and special elections, in entering each vote received by
1  candidates at such election, it shall not be necessary to enter
2  separate tally marks for each vote received by such candidates
3  upon the ballots containing the same votes for the same names,
4  commonly known, and in this act designated as "Straight Party
5  Tickets" for such purpose straight party ticket votes shall be
6  entered carefully as each straight party ticket vote is read on
7  the triplicate tally sheets under the heading "Number of votes
8  received upon the ........................ straight party
9  tickets." Upon completing the number of votes received by each
10  straight party ticket, the number so tallied for each party
11  shall be entered numerically on the extreme right hand margin of
12  each such tally paper]. All ballots, after being removed from
13  the box, shall be kept within the unobstructed view of all
14  persons in the voting room until replaced in the box. No person
15  while handling the ballots shall have in his hand any pencil,
16  pen, stamp or other means of marking or spoiling any ballot. The
17  election officers shall forthwith proceed to canvass and compute
18  the votes cast, and shall not adjourn or postpone the canvass or
19  computation until it shall have been fully completed.
20     (b) When the vote cast for the different persons named upon
21  the ballots and upon the questions, if any, appearing thereon,
22  shall have been fully recorded in the tally papers and counted,
23  the election officers shall duly certify to the number of votes
24  cast for each person (upon the respective party tickets at
25  primaries), and shall prepare in ink two (2) general returns,
26  showing, in addition to the entries made thereon as aforesaid,
27  the total number of ballots received from the county board (the
28  total of each party at primaries), the number of ballots cast
29  (the number of each party at primaries), the number of ballots
30  (of each party at primaries) declared void, and the number of
1  ballots spoiled and cancelled, and any blank ballots cast, as
2  well as the votes cast for each candidate. At elections, the
3  number of votes cast for each candidate by each political party
4  or political body of which such candidate is a nominee shall be
5  separately stated[: Provided, That the number of votes received
6  by each set of candidates upon "straight party tickets" shall be
7  entered opposite the names of the respective candidates in a
8  column immediately adjoining upon the left which column shall be
9  of convenient width and shall be headed "number of votes
10  received upon straight party tickets." In an immediate column to
11  the left thereto, the number of votes received by each candidate
12  upon all ballots other than "straight party tickets" including
13  all ballots known as "split tickets" shall be entered, such
14  column to be of convenient width and shall be headed "number of
15  votes received other than upon straight party tickets." The
16  number of votes received by each candidate as shown in the
17  column headed "number of votes received upon straight party
18  tickets" shall then be added, together with the number of votes
19  received by each candidate as shown in the column headed "number
20  of votes received other than upon straight party tickets"] and
21  thereupon, the total number of votes received by each candidate
22  shall be entered in a column on the extreme right-hand side of
23  the return sheets, which column shall be of convenient width and
24  shall be headed "total number of votes."
25     [Nothing in this section contained shall be construed to
26  authorize or permit the canvassing, counting or tallying ballots
27  with any less degree of strictness than otherwise required by
28  law, the intention of this section being to dispense with the
29  individual tally marks only so far as the so-called "straight
30  party tickets" are concerned, and all other operations of
1  tallying, counting, canvassing and announcing the votes shall
2  proceed as near as may be in accordance with the other
3  provisions of this act.]
4     (c) In returning any votes cast for any person whose name is
5  not printed on the ballot, the election officers shall record
6  any such names exactly as they were written, stamped or applied
7  to the ballot by sticker.
8     Section 8.  Section 1223 of the act, amended January 8, 1960
9  (1959 P.L.2142, No.790) and August 13, 1963 (P.L.707, No.379),
10  is amended to read:
11     Section 1223.  What Ballots Shall Be Counted; Manner of
12  Counting; Defective Ballots.--[(a)] No ballot which is so marked
13  as to be capable of identification shall be counted. Any ballot
14  that is marked in blue, black or blue-black ink, in fountain pen
15  or ball point pen, or black lead pencil or indelible pencil,
16  shall be valid and counted: Provided, That all markings on the
17  ballot are made by the same pen or pencil. Any ballot marked by
18  any other mark than an (X) or check ( ) in the spaces provided
19  for that purpose shall be void and not counted: Provided,
20  however, That no vote recorded thereon shall be declared void
21  because a cross (X) or check ( ) mark thereon is irregular in
22  form. [Any erasure, mutilation or defective marking of the
23  straight party column at November elections shall render the
24  entire ballot void, unless the voter has properly indicated his
25  choice for candidates in any office block, in which case the
26  vote or votes for such candidates only shall be counted.] Any
27  erasure or mutilation in the vote in any office block shall
28  render void the vote for any candidates in said block, but shall
29  not invalidate the votes cast on the remainder of the ballot, if
30  otherwise properly marked. Any ballot indicating a vote for any
1  person whose name is not printed on the ballot, by writing,
2  stamping or sticker, shall be counted as a vote for such person,
3  if placed in the proper space or spaces provided for that
4  purpose, whether or not an (X) or check ( ) is placed after the
5  name of such person: Provided, however, That if such writing,
6  stamping or sticker is placed over the name of a candidate
7  printed on the ballot, it shall render the entire vote in said
8  office block void. If an elector shall mark his ballot for more
9  persons for any office than there are candidates to be voted for
10  such office, or if, for any reason, it may be impossible to
11  determine his choice for any office, his ballot shall not be
12  counted for such office, but the ballot shall be counted for all
13  offices for which it is properly marked. Ballots not marked, or
14  improperly or defectively marked, so that the whole ballot is
15  void, shall be set aside and shall be preserved with the other
16  ballots.
17     [(b) At November elections, a cross (X) or check ( ) mark in
18  the square opposite the name of political party or political
19  body in the party column shall be counted as a vote for every
20  candidate of that party or body so marked, including its
21  candidates for presidential electors, except for those offices
22  as to which the voter has indicated a choice for individual
23  candidates of the same or another party or body in any office
24  block, in which case the ballot for such office block shall be
25  counted only for the candidates thus individually marked,
26  notwithstanding the fact that the voter has made a mark in the
27  party column, and even though in the case of an office for which
28  more than one candidate is to be voted for, he has not
29  individually marked for such office the full number of
30  candidates for which he is entitled to vote.]
1     Section 9.  This act shall take effect in one year.
