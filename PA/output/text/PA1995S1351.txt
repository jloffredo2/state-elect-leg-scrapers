11     (a) The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
12  application filed by a qualified elector not required to be
13  registered under preceding section 1301, shall ascertain from
14  the information on such application, district register or from
15  any other source that such applicant possesses all the
16  qualifications of a qualified elector other than being
17  registered or enrolled. If the board is satisfied that the
18  applicant is qualified to receive an official absentee ballot,
19  the application shall be marked approved such approval decision
20  shall be final and binding except that challenges may be made
21  only on the ground that the applicant did not possess
22  qualifications of an absentee elector. Such challenges must be
23  made to the county board of elections prior to [5:00] 4:00
24  o'clock P. M. on the [first Friday prior to] Monday immediately
25  preceding the election. When so approved, the county board of
26  elections shall cause the applicant's name and residence (and at
27  a primary, the party enrollment) to be inserted in the Military,
28  Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters File as
29  provided in section 1302.3, subsection (b): Providing, however,
30  That no application of any qualified elector in military service
1  shall be rejected for failure to include on his application any
2  information if such information may be ascertained within a
3  reasonable time by the county board of elections.
4     (b) The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
5  application filed by a qualified elector who is entitled, under
6  the provisions of the Permanent Registration Law as now or
7  hereinafter enacted by the General Assembly, to absentee
8  registration prior to or concurrently with the time of voting as
9  provided under preceding section 1301, shall ascertain from the
10  information on such application or from any other source that
11  such applicant possesses all the qualifications of a qualified
12  elector. If the board is satisfied that the applicant is
13  entitled, under the provisions of the Permanent Registration Law
14  as now or hereinafter enacted by the General Assembly, to
15  absentee registration prior to or concurrently with the time of
16  voting and that the applicant is qualified to receive an
17  official absentee ballot, the application shall be marked
18  "approved." Such approval decision shall be final and binding
19  except that challenges may be made only on the ground that the
20  applicant did not possess the qualifications of an absentee
21  elector prior to or concurrently with the time of voting. Such
22  challenges must be made to the county board of elections prior
23  to [5:00] 4:00 o'clock P. M. on the [first Friday prior to]
24  Monday immediately preceding the election. When so approved, the
25  county board of elections shall cause the applicant's name and
26  residence (and at a primary, the party enrollment) to be
27  inserted in the Military, Veterans and Emergency Civilian
28  Absentee Voters File as provided in section 1302.3 subsection
29  (b).
30     (c) The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
1  application of a qualified elector required to be registered
2  under the provisions of preceding section 1301, shall determine
3  the qualifications of such applicant by comparing the
4  information set forth on such application with the information
5  contained on the applicant's permanent registration card. If the
6  board is satisfied that the applicant is qualified to receive an
7  official absentee ballot, the application shall be marked
8  "approved." Such approval decision shall be final and binding,
9  except that challenges may be made only on the ground that the
10  applicant did not possess the qualifications of an absentee
11  elector. Such challenges must be made to the county board of
12  elections prior to [5:00] four o'clock P. M. on the [first
13  Friday prior to] Monday immediately preceding the election. When
14  so approved, the registration commission shall cause an absentee
15  voter's temporary registration card to be inserted in the
16  district register on top of and along with the permanent
17  registration card. The absentee voter's temporary registration
18  card shall be in the color and form prescribed in subsection (e)
19  of this section:
20     Provided, however, That the duties of the county boards of
21  elections and the registration commissions with respect to the
22  insertion of the absentee voter's temporary registration card of
23  any elector from the district register as set forth in section
24  1302.2 shall include only such applications and emergency
25  applications as are received on or before the first Tuesday
26  prior to the primary or election. In all cases where
27  applications are received after the first Tuesday prior to the
28  primary or election and before [five] four o'clock P. M. on the
29  [first Friday prior to] Monday immediately preceding the primary
30  or election, the county board of elections shall determine the
1  qualifications of such applicant by comparing the information
2  set forth on such application with the information contained on
3  the applicant's duplicate registration card on file in the
4  General Register (also referred to as the Master File) in the
5  office of the Registration Commission and shall cause the name
6  and residence (and at primaries, the party enrollment) to be
7  inserted in the Military, Veterans and Emergency Civilian
8  Absentee Voters File as provided in section 1302.3, subsection
9  (b). In addition, the local district boards of elections shall,
10  upon canvassing the official absentee ballots under section
11  1308, examine the voting check list of the election district of
12  said elector's residence and satisfy itself that such elector
13  did not cast any ballot other than the one properly issued to
14  him under his absentee ballot application. In all cases where
15  the examination of the local district board of elections
16  discloses that an elector did vote a ballot other than the one
17  properly issued to him under the absentee ballot application,
18  the local district board of elections shall thereupon cancel
19  said absentee ballot and said elector shall be subject to the
20  penalties as hereinafter set forth.
21     (d) In the event that any application for an official
22  absentee ballot is not approved by the county board of
23  elections, the elector shall be notified immediately to that
24  effect with a statement by the county board of the reasons for
25  the disapproval.
26     (e) The absentee voter's temporary registration card shall be
27  in duplicate and the same size as the permanent registration
28  card, in a different and contrasting color to the permanent
29  registration card and shall contain the absentee voter's name
30  and address and shall conspicuously contain the words "Absentee
1  Voter." Such card shall also contain the affidavit required by
2  subsection (b) of section 1306.
3     Section 1306.  Voting by Absentee Electors.--(a) At any time
4  after receiving an official absentee ballot, but on or before
5  [five] four o'clock P. M. on the [Friday prior to] Monday
6  immediately preceding the primary or election, the elector
7  shall, in secret, proceed to mark the ballot only in black lead
8  pencil, indelible pencil or blue, black or blue-black ink, in
9  fountain pen or ball point pen, and then fold the ballot,
10  enclose and securely seal the same in the envelope on which is
11  printed, stamped or endorsed "Official Absentee Ballot." This
12  envelope shall then be placed in the second one, on which is
13  printed the form of declaration of the elector, and the address
14  of the elector's county board of election and the local election
15  district of the elector. The elector shall then fill out, date
16  and sign the declaration printed on such envelope. Such envelope
17  shall then be securely sealed and the elector shall send same by
18  mail, postage prepaid, except where franked, or deliver it in
19  person to said county board of election:
20     Provided, however, That any elector, spouse of the elector or
21  dependent of the elector, qualified in accordance with the
22  provisions of section 1301, subsections (e), (f), (g) and (h) to
23  vote by absentee ballot as herein provided, shall be required to
24  include on the form of declaration a supporting declaration in
25  form prescribed by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, to be
26  signed by the head of the department or chief of division or
27  bureau in which the elector is employed, setting forth the
28  identity of the elector, spouse of the elector or dependent of
29  the elector:
30     Provided further, That any elector who has filed his
1  application in accordance with section 1302 subsection (e) (2),
2  and is unable to sign his declaration because of illness or
3  physical disability, shall be excused from signing upon making a
4  declaration which shall be witnessed by one adult person in
5  substantially the following form: I hereby declare that I am
6  unable to sign my declaration for voting my absentee ballot
7  without assistance because I am unable to write by reason of my
8  illness or physical disability. I have made or received
9  assistance in making my mark in lieu of my signature.

19     (a)  The county boards of election, upon receipt of official
20  absentee ballots in such envelopes, shall safely keep the same
21  in sealed or locked containers until they distribute same to the
22  appropriate local election districts in a manner prescribed by
23  the Secretary of the Commonwealth.
24     The county board of elections shall then distribute the
25  absentee ballots, unopened, to the absentee voter's respective
26  election district concurrently with the distribution of the
27  other election supplies. Absentee ballots shall be canvassed
28  immediately and continuously without interruption until
29  completed after the close of the polls on the day of the
30  election in each election district. The results of the canvass
1  of the absentee ballots shall then be included in and returned
2  to the county board with the returns of that district. No
3  absentee ballot shall be counted which is received in the office
4  of the county board of election later than [five] four o'clock
5  P. M. on the [Friday] Monday immediately preceding the primary
