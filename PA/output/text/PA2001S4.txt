24     county another county and who is not registered to vote in

17  names on the ballot or on the voting machine labels or is unable
18  to see or mark the ballot or operate the voting machine or to
19  enter the voting compartment or voting machine booth without
20  assistance, the following apply:
21         (1)  The elector may, at least ten days prior to the next

28     card, the elector may receive assistance if the elector
29     completes a declaration in the polling place.
30         (5)  Following the election the commission shall examine
1     declarations completed under this section and shall update
2     the elector's voter registration card to reflect the need for
3     assistance and the nature of the disability.
4     (b)  Termination.--If the commission ascertains that an
5  elector who has declared need for assistance is no longer in
6  need of assistance, it shall cancel on the registration card the

26  update information contained in its registration records.
27     (c)  Corrections.--An individual incorrectly reported
28  deceased by the Department of Health or incorrectly removed by

2     (b)  Voter removal program.--
3         (1)  The commission shall establish a program to identify
4     electors whose address may have changed by establishing one
5     of the following programs:
6             (i)  National change of address. The secretary shall
7         establish by regulation a program whereby information
8         supplied by the United States Postal Service through its
9         licensees is used on a periodic basis, but not less than
10         once every calendar year, to identify electors who may
11         have changed addresses. The information shall be
12         incorporated in the [administration of the Statewide
13         central registry] SURE system and shall be forwarded to
14         the commissions in a manner determined by the secretary
15         by regulation.
16                 (A)  If it appears from the information provided
17             through the United States Postal Service that an
18             elector has moved to a different residence address
19             within the same county as the elector is currently
20             registered, the commission shall change the
21             registration records to show the new address and
22             shall send the elector, to the address recorded on
23             the elector's registration, a notice of the change of
24             address by forwardable mail and a postage prepaid,
25             preaddressed return form by which the elector may
26             verify or correct the address information.
27                 (B)  If it appears from the information provided
28             through the United States Postal Service that an
29             elector has moved to a different residence address
30             outside the county, the commission shall use the
1             notice procedure described in clause (A).
2             (ii)  Confirmation mailing:
3                 (A)  A commission may establish a program by
4             sending a direct, nonforwardable first class "return
5             if undeliverable - address correction requested"
6             mailing to all registered electors in the county.
7                 (B)  If this program is established, the
8             commission shall use the notice procedure described
9             in subparagraph (i)(A) for any elector whose mailing
10             is returned undeliverable.
11         (2)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
12     program established under paragraph (1), a canvass may be
13     used as follows:
14             (i)  The registration commission may, by
15         commissioners or by inspectors of registration, verify
16         the registration in an election district by visiting the
17         building from which an elector is registered and other
18         buildings as the commission deems necessary.
19             (ii)  The commission shall make a record of the name
20         and address of each registered elector who is found not
21         to reside at the registered address or who for any other
22         reason appears to be not qualified to vote in the
23         registered election district.
24             (iii)  The commission shall leave at the address of
25         each person referred to in subparagraph (ii) a notice
26         requiring him to communicate with the commission on or
27         before a date which the commission shall designate, and
28         which shall be not less than seven days and not more than
29         15 days from the date of the notice and in any case not
30         later than the 15th day preceding the election next
1         ensuing, and satisfy the commission of his qualifications
2         as an elector. The commission shall cause a confirmation
3         of each such notice to be sent by mail promptly to such
4         person at the address from which he is registered. The
5         envelope containing such information is to be plainly
6         marked that it is not to be forwarded. At the expiration
7         of the time specified in the notice, the commission shall
8         cancel the registration of such person who has not
9         communicated with the commission and proved his
10         qualifications as an elector.
11             (iv)  To facilitate the canvass under this section,
12         the commission may, when necessary, appoint special
13         inspectors of registration, in number not exceeding
14         double the number of election districts being canvassed.
15             (v)  Special inspectors must be qualified electors of
16         the county. They shall be appointed without reference to
17         residence in election districts or to political
18         affiliations or beliefs. The commission shall instruct
19         special inspectors in their duties. Special inspectors
20         have the powers conferred by this act upon inspectors of
21         registration.
22         (3)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
23     program established under paragraph (1), the commission shall
24     send a notice pursuant to subsection (d) to any elector who
25     has not voted nor appeared to vote during the period
26     beginning five years before the date of the notice and ending
27     on the date of the notice and for whom the board of elections
28     did not during that period in any other way receive any
29     information that the voter still resides in the registered
30     election district.
1         (4)  Commissions shall complete, not later than 90 days
2     before each primary, at least once per year the voter removal
3     programs under this section[.], and shall promptly update
4     information contained in its registration records. This
5     paragraph shall not be construed to preclude any of the
6     following:
7             (i)  Cancellation of an elector's registration as
8         provided for under subsection (a)(1) or (2).

13  been mailed a form under subsection (b)(1) or (3) and has failed
14  to respond, which shall be included with all other registration
15  cards for that polling site and located at the individual's
16  polling site on the day of the election.
17     (d)  Cancellation of registration.--
18         (1)  A commission shall not cancel the registration of an

12             the elector must return the card not later than 30
13             days prior to the next election. If the card is not
14             returned, affirmation or confirmation of the
15             elector's address may be required before the elector
