16  investigation which may include investigation of reports and
17  statements made or failed to be made by the complainant and any

4  enforcement officer in accordance with section 1642 (a) and (b)
5  and shall make available to such law enforcement officer all

20  No.63), are amended and the section is amended by adding clauses
21  to read:
22     Section 1621.  Definitions.--As used in this article, the
23  following words have the following meanings:
24     * * *
25     (d)  The word "expenditure" shall mean:
26     (1)  The payment, distribution, loan or advancement of money
27  or any valuable thing by a candidate, political committee or
28  other person for the purpose of influencing the outcome of an
29  election; Provided, however, That such payment, distribution,
30  loan or advancement of money or any valuable thing must be made
1  only for legitimate and verifiable campaign expenses and not for
2  any inherently personal purpose. "Inherently personal purpose"
3  means a purpose that, by its nature, confers a personal benefit,
4  including a home mortgage, rent, utility payment, clothing
5  purchase, noncampaign automobile expense, country club
6  membership, vacation or a trip of a noncampaign nature,
7  household food items, tuition payments, admission to a sporting
8  event, concert, theater or other form of entertainment.

10  money or other valuable thing between or among political
11  committees;
12     (3)  The providing of a service or other valuable thing for
13  the purpose of influencing the outcome of a nomination or
14  election of any person to any public office to be voted for in
15  this Commonwealth; or

17  thing by any person other than a candidate or political
18  committee, to compensate any person for services rendered to a
19  candidate or political committee.

21  expenditures made by a candidate for which the candidate is
22  reimbursed by his or her political committee within the
23  reporting period the expenditure was made. Such expenditure made
24  by the candidate is subject, however, to the requirements of
25  section 1626(c).
26     (e)  [The words "independent expenditure" shall mean an
27  expenditure by a person made for the purpose of influencing an

1  suggestion of any candidate or political committee or agent
2  thereof.]
3     The words "independent expenditure" shall mean an expenditure
4  by a person for a communication expressly advocating the

11  expenditure. For purposes of this definition:
12     (1)  The word "agent" shall mean any person who has actual
13  oral or written authority, either express or implied, to make or
14  to authorize the making of expenditures on behalf of a
15  candidate, or shall mean any person who has been placed in a
16  position within the campaign organization where it would
17  reasonably appear that in the ordinary course of campaign-
18  related activities he may authorize expenditures.
19     (2)  The words "clearly identified candidate" shall mean that
20  the name of the candidate appears, a photograph or drawing of
21  the candidate appears or the identity of the candidate is
22  otherwise apparent by unambiguous reference.
23     (3)  The words "expressly advocating" shall mean any
24  communication that advocates the election or defeat of a
25  candidate by:
26     (i)  containing the name of the candidate, a picture of the
27  candidate or expressions such as "vote for", "elect", "support",
28  "vote against", "defeat" or "reject" or a campaign slogan or
29  words that in context can have no reasonable meaning other than
30  to advocate the election or defeat of one or more clearly
1  identified candidates;
2     (ii)  referring to one or more clearly identified candidates
3  in a paid advertisement that is transmitted through radio or
4  television within 60 calendar days preceding the date of an

9  such as the proximity to an election.

16  party or agent of the candidate or party, or a candidate's agent
17  or a person who is coordinating with a candidate or a

20  "support," "vote against," "defeat," or "reject" or other slogan
21  or words along with the name or picture of the candidate that in
22  context can have no reasonable meaning other than to urge the
23  election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidates.
24     (4)  The words "made with the cooperation or prior consent
25  of, in consultation or concert with or at the request or
26  suggestion of a candidate or any agent or authorized committee
27  of the candidate" shall mean any arrangement, coordination or
28  direction by the candidate or his agent prior to the
29  publication, distribution, display or broadcast of the
30  communication. An expenditure shall be presumed to be so made
1  when it is:
2     (i)  Based on information about the candidate's plans,
3  projects or needs provided to the expending person by the
4  candidate or by the candidate's agents, with a view toward
5  having an expenditure made.
6     (ii)  Made by or through any person who is or has been
7  authorized to raise or expend funds, who is or has been an
8  officer of an authorized committee, including a political party
9  committee, or who is or has been receiving any form of
10  compensation from the candidate, the candidate's committee or

14  political committee as defined in subsection (h) which receives
15  contributions and makes expenditures to, or on behalf of, any
16  candidate other than a candidate's own authorized political
17  committees or the political committees of any State, county,
18  city, borough, township, ward or other regularly constituted
19  party committee of any political party or political body. A
20  political action committee which is established, maintained or
21  controlled by a sponsoring organization such as a corporation,
22  labor organization, membership association or trade association
23  shall include in its registered name the full name of its
24  sponsoring organization.
25     * * *
26     (n)  The words "affiliate" or "affiliated committee" shall
27  include:
28     (1)  Any committee established or authorized by a candidate
29  as part of his or her campaign for the same election for office.
30     (2)  Any committee established, financed, maintained or
1  controlled by the same corporation, labor organization, person
2  or group of persons, including any parent, subsidiary, branch,
3  division, department or local unit thereof. Local units may
4  include, in appropriate cases, a franchisee, licensee or
5  regional association.
6     (o)  The words "in-kind contribution" shall mean a
7  contribution of goods, services, property or any valuable thing
8  offered free or at less than the usual and normal charge for
9  such goods or services, but shall not include any legal or
10  accounting services rendered to or on behalf of any political
11  committee of a political party, an authorized committee of a
12  candidate or any other political committee, if such services are
13  solely for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this article.
14  Such legal or accounting services, however, shall be reported
15  pursuant to section 1631.
16     Section 10.  Section 1622(b) of the act, added October 4,
17  1978 (P.L.893, No.171), is amended to read:
18     Section 1622.  Organization of Political Committees;
19  Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer; Records of Candidate and
20  Committees.--
21     * * *
22     (b)  Every candidate [who authorizes a committee or
23  committees,] for public office must authorize a political
24  committee to receive and disburse funds on behalf of this
25  candidacy, and shall name a sole treasurer[, irrespective of the
26  number of committees so authorized,] to receive and disburse all
27  funds for said [committees.] committee. No more than one such
28  committee shall be formed per office sought. Nothing herein
29  shall be construed to prohibit a candidate from receiving or
30  expending moneys on his behalf or a treasurer of a political
1  party committee or a committee authorized to receive and
2  distribute funds on behalf of more than one (1) candidate from
3  receiving or expending moneys on behalf of said candidates,
4  notwithstanding the appointment of a sole treasurer. A sole
5  treasurer may delegate authority, in writing, to any number of
6  assistant treasurers to receive and disburse moneys collected on
7  behalf of a candidate for election. Nothing in this section
8  shall prohibit authorized individuals from selling tickets or

10  account of the candidate.

30  however, That if the amount received or expended by a candidate

5     Section 1627.  [Annual Reports] Quarterly Reports;
6  Termination of Committees.--
7     (a)  All political committees and candidates, [including
8  those committees and candidates] not filing reports under
9  section 1626 (d) and (e), shall file [a report on January 31 of
10  each year which shall be complete as of December 31 of the prior

12  there is no balance or debt in the report of the candidate or
13  political committee. Such reports shall be cumulative. However,
14  if there has been no change in the account, then the candidate
15  or political committee shall file a statement to that effect
16  with the appropriate supervisor. Each form designated by the
17  Secretary of the Commonwealth for filing a report or statement
18  required by section 1626(e) shall contain a block which may be
19  marked by the candidate or political committee designating it a
20  termination report or statement. If such report or statement is
21  so designated, or if an authorized candidate elects to file no
22  report or statement pursuant to section 1626.1, no annual report
23  need be filed under this section unless contributions were
24  received or expenditures made subsequent to the time period for
25  filing of such termination report. However, no candidate or
26  political committee may terminate by way of a statement where
27  the unpaid balance indicated in the previous report was greater
28  than two hundred fifty dollars ($250). In the case of annual
29  reports said report shall cover the campaign activity of a
30  candidate or political committee from the last prior report or
1  statement.] quarterly reports. Such reports shall be filed on
2  the fifteenth day following the last day of the third, sixth,
3  ninth and twelfth month of each year and shall be complete as of

5  that there is no balance or debt in the report of the candidate
6  or political committee. Such reports shall be cumulative. A
7  report must be filed even if there was no change in the account
8  since the last filing. Each form designated by the State board
9  of elections for filing a report required by section 1626(e)
10  shall contain a block which may be marked by the candidate or
11  political committee designating it a termination report or
12  statement. No candidate or political committee may terminate
13  unless such candidate or committee has a zero balance. No
14  candidate or committee may terminate by way of a statement. In
15  the case of quarterly reports, said report shall cover the
16  campaign activity of a candidate or political committee from the
17  last prior report or statement. Once terminated, a political
18  committee must comply with sections 1623 and 1624 before
19  receiving contributions or making expenditures.
20     [(b)  Any political committee required to be registered under
21  this act and not reporting under section 1626 shall file an
22  annual report under this section. However, if a political
23  committee makes aggregate expenditures as defined in section
24  1621 in an amount less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or
25  incurs aggregate debt in an amount less than two hundred fifty
26  dollars ($250) during the calendar year to influence an
27  election, it need not file an annual report; provided that this
28  exception shall not be applicable to a candidate's political
29  committee or to a State or county committee of a political party
30  or political body or to a political action committee of a
1  corporation or unincorporated association.]
2     Section 13.  Section 1628 of the act, amended February 13,

10  this act, of five hundred dollars ($500) or more] after the
11  final pre-election report has been deemed completed shall report
12  such contribution[, pledge or expenditure] or pledge to the
13  appropriate supervisor. Such report shall be sent by the
14  candidate, chairman or treasurer of the political committee
15  within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt of the contribution.
16  [It shall be the duty of the supervisor to confirm the substance
17  of such report.] The report shall be made by telegram, mailgram,
18  overnight mail [or], facsimile or other electronic transmission.
19  Any candidate in his own behalf, or chairman, treasurer or
