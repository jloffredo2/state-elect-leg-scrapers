21     (a)  Development and implementation.--
22         (1)  The department shall develop and implement uniform
23     voting procedures that shall be used at all elections held in
24     this Commonwealth. In developing and implementing uniform
25     voting procedures, the department may use any available
26     research and reports issued by Federal or State agencies
27     relevant to developing and implementing uniform voting
28     procedures, including any research, reports and
29     recommendations issued by the Joint State Government
30     Commission.
1         (2)  Prior to implementing uniform voting procedures, the
2     department shall receive input from counties, including
3     comments and recommendations from members of county boards
4     and district election boards.
5     (b)  Criteria for uniform voting procedures.--In developing
6  and implementing uniform voting procedures, the department shall
7  use, but is not limited to, the following criteria:
8         (1)  The procedures shall be easy for qualified electors
9     to understand and use. In order to assist the district
10     election board in confirming a qualified elector's
11     registration and in resolving registration problems, the
12     procedures may include the use by qualified electors of an
13     identification card that may be read at the polling place by
14     a computer linking the district election board directly to
15     the county board.
16         (2)  The procedures shall protect the privacy of
17     qualified electors and the security of their voters and shall
18     prevent voter fraud.
19         (3)  The procedures shall provide prompt and accurate
20     election results from the district election board to the
21     county board, media and public. The procedures may include a
22     computer network that directly links the district election
23     board at the polling place to the county board for prompt and
24     secure transmission of election results.
25         (4)  The procedures shall be standardized for use at all
26     elections held in this Commonwealth. The procedures may not
27     include punch cards and other voting methods that could
28     potentially result in incorrect voting such as double voting.
29         (5)  The procedures shall use technological advances
30     including systems that utilize touch-screen computers and the
1     Internet.
2  Section 4.  Repeals.
3     All acts and parts of acts are repealed insofar as they are
4  inconsistent with the provisions of this act.

7  shall be implemented and applied to all elections held in this
8  Commonwealth on or after January 1, 2002.
