15     Section 1.  Section 530(a) of the act of June 3, 1937

17  amended to read:
18     Section 530.  Equipment and Arrangement of Polling Places;
19  Guard Rail; Number of Voting Compartments or Voting Machines.--
20     (a)  (1)  The county board of elections shall cause all rooms
21  used as polling places to be suitably provided with heat and
22  light, and, in districts in which ballots are used, with a
1  sufficient number of voting compartments or booths with proper
2  supplies, in which electors may conveniently mark their ballots,
3  with a curtain, screen or door in the upper part of the front of
4  each compartment or booth so that in the marking thereof they
5  may be screened from the observation of others.
6     (2)  Every polling place shall consist of a single room,
7  every part of which is within the unobstructed view of those
8  present therein, and shall be furnished with a guard rail or
9  barrier enclosing the inner portion of the said room, which
10  guard rail or barrier shall be so constructed and placed that
11  only such persons as are inside said rail or barrier can
12  approach within six feet of the ballot box and voting
13  compartments, or booths, or voting machines, as the case may be.
14     (3)  No ballot item on a voting machine may be placed at a
15  height greater than five feet six inches from the surface on
16  which an elector stands. Every polling place shall be equipped
17  with at least one stepstool or similar device to assist electors
18  in easily reaching and reading all ballot items.
19     (4)  The ballot box and voting compartments or booths shall
20  be so arranged in the voting room within the enclosed space as
21  to be in full view of those persons in the room outside the said
22  guard rail or barrier. The voting machine or machines shall be
23  so placed in the voting room within the enclosed space that,
24  unless its construction shall otherwise require, the ballot
25  labels on the face of the machine can be plainly seen by the
26  election officers, overseers and watchers when the machine is
27  not occupied by an elector.
