19     (a)  Each candidate for nomination or election at any
20  election shall be entitled to appoint two watchers in each
21  election district in which such candidate is voted for. Each
22  political party and each political body which has nominated
1  candidates in accordance with the provisions of this act, shall
2  be entitled to appoint three watchers at any general, municipal
3  or special election in each election district in which the
4  candidates of such party or political body are to be voted for.
5  Upon petition of any organized body of citizens to the county
6  board of elections, the board shall appoint a number of
7  additional watchers representing the organized body of citizens
8  not to exceed two watchers per election district at any primary
9  election and not to exceed three watchers per election district
10  at any general, municipal or special election. Said petition
11  shall set forth the name of the organized body of citizens and
12  the election district or districts in which the organized body
13  of citizens seeks to place watchers. Such watchers shall serve
14  without expense to the county.
15     (b)  All watchers so appointed shall serve in only one
16  district and must be qualified registered electors of the
17  municipality or township in which the district where they are
18  authorized to act is located. Only one watcher for each
19  candidate or organized body of citizens at primaries, or for
20  each party [or], political body or organized body of citizens at
21  general, municipal or special elections, shall be allowed to
22  remain in the polling place at any one time prior to the close
23  of the polls, and all watchers in the room shall remain outside
24  the enclosed space. After the close of the polls and while the
25  ballots are being counted or voting machine canvassed, all the
26  watchers shall be permitted to be in the polling place outside
27  the enclosed space. Each watcher shall be provided with a
28  certificate from the county board of elections, stating his name
29  and the name of the candidate, party [or], political body or
30  organized body of citizens he represents. Watchers shall be
1  required to show their certificates when requested to do so.
2  Watchers allowed in the polling place under the provisions of
3  this act, shall be permitted to keep a list of voters and shall
4  be entitled to challenge any person making application to vote
5  and to require proof of his qualifications, as provided by this
6  act. All watchers so appointed as set forth above, who are to
7  serve in a district other than the one from which they are
8  registered electors, are to be appointed on petition to the
9  court of common pleas. Said petition shall set forth that the
10  watcher is a qualified voter of the municipality or township in
11  which the district is located and that said watcher is a law
12  abiding citizen and of good repute, and the court shall consider
13  all factors relevant to said petition before granting or
14  refusing same.
15     (c)  No candidate, organized body of citizens or committee of
16  a political party or of a political body, nor any other person
17  or persons shall pay to any watcher compensation in excess of
18  twenty ($20.00) dollars per diem.
19     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
