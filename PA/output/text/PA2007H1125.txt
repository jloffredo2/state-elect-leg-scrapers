9     Section 1.  Section 1502 of the act of March 10, 1949
10  (P.L.30, No.14), known as the Public School Code of 1949,
11  amended June 25, 1997 (P.L.297, No.30), is amended to read:
12     Section 1502.  Days Schools not to be Kept Open.--(a)
13  [Except as provided in subsection (c), no] No school shall be
14  kept open on any Saturday for the purpose of ordinary
15  instruction, except when Monday is fixed by the board of school
16  directors as the weekly holiday, or on Sunday, Memorial Day,
17  Fourth of July, Christmas, Thanksgiving, the First of January
18  and up to five additional days designated as local holidays in
19  the adopted school calendar by the board of school directors as
1  official local school district holidays, nor shall any school be
2  kept open in any district during the time of holding the
3  teachers' institute for such district. The board of school
4  directors may cancel any day designated as a local holiday in
5  the event of a weather emergency or natural disaster.
6     [(c)  For the school year 1995-1996 only, the board of school
7  directors shall have the option of rescheduling instructional
8  days on Saturday, but for not more than one Saturday per month,
9  to make up instructional days lost from the adopted school
10  calendar because school was closed as a result of the weather
11  emergency of 1996. In those cases where a board of directors
12  chooses to reschedule instructional days on Saturdays in
13  accordance with the provisions of this section, schools within
14  such board's jurisdiction shall not schedule tests or
15  examinations on these Saturdays. Notwithstanding the provisions
16  of subsection (a), if the board of school directors reschedules
17  an instructional day on Saturday, the schools may be open the
18  following Monday.]
19     (d)  (1)  To the extent possible, the board of school
20  directors in each school district shall schedule in-service days
21  for professional activities, professional meetings or parent-
22  teacher conferences on the days of municipal, general and
23  primary elections.
24     (2)  If schools are kept open for student instruction on the
25  days of municipal, general and primary elections, the board of
26  school directors in the school district shall take reasonable
27  safety and security measures to safeguard students and school
28  staff in schools used as polling places. Such measures may
29  include, but not be limited to:
30     (i)  Utilizing gates or barricades.
1     (ii)  Requiring voters to park off-campus.
2     (iii)  Providing clear signage for voter entrances and exits.
3     (iv)  Providing an increased presence of school security
4  staff.
5     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
