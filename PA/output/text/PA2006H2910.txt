15     Section 1.  Section 1111-A of the act of June 3, 1937
16  (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code,
17  added July 11, 1980 (P.L.600, No.128), is amended to read:
18     Section 1111-A.  Instruction of Voters.--(a)  During the
19  thirty days next preceding an election at which any electronic
20  voting system is to be used, the county board of elections shall
21  place on public exhibition, in such public places and in such
1  quantity and at such times as it shall deem most suitable for
2  the instruction and information of the voters of the county,
3  those components of the electronic voting system which are used
4  by the voter, containing a sample ballot designed for
5  instructional use. Such components shall be under the charge and
6  care of a person competent as custodian and instructor. No
7  voting system component which is assigned for use in an election
8  shall be used for such public exhibition and instruction after
9  having been prepared and sealed for the election.
10     (b)  At the polling place on the day of the election, each

12  diagrams and a model, in the operation of the voting device
13  before he enters the voting booth and of the ability to complete
14  a paper ballot under section 1123-A. If any voter shall ask for
15  further instructions concerning the manner of voting after
16  entering the voting booth, any election officer may give him
17  audible instructions without entering such booth, but no such
18  election officer shall when giving such instructions in any
19  manner request, suggest or seek to persuade or induce any such
20  voter to vote any particular ticket or for any particular
21  candidate or other person or for or against any particular
22  question.
23     (c)  During the thirty days next preceding an election at
24  which any electronic voting system in which votes are registered
25  electronically is to be used, the county board of elections
26  shall conduct a public education program to inform voters of
27  their right to complete a paper ballot under section 1123-A. The
28  county board of elections shall place signs at each polling
29  place notifying voters of their right to complete a paper ballot
30  under section 1123-A.
1     Section 2.  The act is amended by adding a section to read:
2     Section 1123-A.  Right to Use Paper Ballots.--(a)

4  election district which uses an electronic voting system in
5  which votes are registered electronically shall have the right
6  to complete a paper ballot under this section.
7     (b)  Paper ballots utilized under subsection (a) shall be
8  manually counted and shall not be entered into an electronic
9  voting system in any manner.
10     (c)  Paper ballots utilized under subsection (a) shall be
11  printed for any election or office and the election shall be
12  conducted by the election officers provided for in this act and
13  the ballots counted and the return of the ballots made in the
14  manner required by law for such offices insofar as paper ballots
15  are used.
16     Section 3.  The following provisions shall apply to elections
