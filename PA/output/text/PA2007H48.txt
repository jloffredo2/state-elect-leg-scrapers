15     Section 1.  Section 1223(a) of the act of June 3, 1937
16  (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code,
17  amended August 13, 1963 (P.L.707, No.379), is amended to read:
18     Section 1223.  What Ballots Shall Be Counted; Manner of
19  Counting; Defective Ballots.--(a) No ballot which is so marked
20  as to be capable of identification shall be counted. Any ballot
21  that is marked in blue, black or blue-black ink, in fountain pen
22  or ball point pen, or black lead pencil or indelible pencil,
1  shall be valid and counted: Provided, That all markings on the
2  ballot are made by the same pen or pencil. Any ballot marked by
3  any other mark than an (X) or check ( ) in the spaces provided
4  for that purpose shall be void and not counted: Provided,
5  however, That no vote recorded thereon shall be declared void
6  because a cross (X) or check ( ) mark thereon is irregular in
7  form. Any erasure, mutilation or defective marking of the
8  straight party column at November elections shall render the
9  entire ballot void, unless the voter has properly indicated his
10  choice for candidates in any office block, in which case the
11  vote or votes for such candidates only shall be counted. Any
12  erasure or mutilation in the vote in any office block shall
13  render void the vote for any candidates in said block, but shall
14  not invalidate the votes cast on the remainder of the ballot, if
15  otherwise properly marked. Any ballot indicating a vote for any
16  person whose name is not printed on the ballot, by writing,
17  stamping or sticker, shall be counted as a vote for such person,
18  if placed in the proper space or spaces provided for that
19  purpose, whether or not an (X) or check ( ) is placed after the
20  name of such person: Provided, however, That if such writing,
21  stamping or sticker is placed over the name of a candidate
22  printed on the ballot, it shall render the entire vote in said
23  office block void. If an elector shall mark his ballot for more
24  persons for any office than there are candidates to be voted for
25  for such office, or if, for any reason, it may be impossible to
26  determine his choice for any office, his ballot shall not be
27  counted for such office, but the ballot shall be counted for all
28  offices for which it is properly marked. On any ballot
29  indicating a vote for any person whose name is not printed on
30  the ballot because the name of such person was removed from the
1  ballot according to law for any reason, the entire vote in said
2  office shall be rendered void. Ballots not marked, or improperly
3  or defectively marked, so that the whole ballot is void, shall
4  be set aside and shall be preserved with the other ballots.
