7  absentee ballot for the qualified elector. The numbers shall
8  appear legibly and in a conspicuous place but before the ballots
9  are distributed the number on the ballot shall be torn off by
10  the county board of election. This number information shall be
11  appropriately inserted and become a part of the Registered
12  Absentee Voters File and the Military, Veterans and Emergency
13  Civilian Absentee Voters File provided in section 1302.3 of this
14  act.
15     (i)  Application for official absentee ballots shall be on
16  forms prescribed by the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The
17  application shall state that a voter who receives an absentee
18  ballot pursuant to section 1301 and who, on election day, is
19  capable of voting at the appropriate polling place must void the
20  absentee ballot and vote in the normal manner at the appropriate
21  voting place. Such forms shall be made freely available to the
22  public at county board of elections, municipal buildings and at
23  such other locations designated by the secretary. No written
24  application or personal request shall be necessary to receive
25  the application forms. Copies of all completed applications for
26  official absentee ballots shall be retained by the county board
27  of elections.

18  then fold the ballot, enclose and securely seal the same in the

21  second one, on which is printed the form of declaration of the

12  physical disability, shall be excused from signing upon making a
13  declaration which shall be witnessed by one adult person in
14  substantially the following form: I hereby declare that I am
15  unable to sign my declaration for voting my absentee ballot
16  without assistance because I am unable to write by reason of my
17  illness or physical disability. I have made or received
18  assistance in making my mark in lieu of my signature.

26     (b) In the event that any such elector, excepting an elector
27  in military service or any elector unable to go to his polling
28  place because of illness or physical disability, entitled to
29  vote an official absentee ballot shall be in the [county]
30  municipality of his residence on the day for holding the primary
1  or election for which the ballot was issued, or in the event any
2  such elector shall have recovered from his illness or physical
3  disability sufficiently to permit him to present himself at the
4  proper polling place for the purpose of casting his ballot, such
5  absentee ballot cast by such elector shall, be declared void.
6     Any such elector referred to in this subsection, who is
7  within the [county] municipality of his residence must present
8  himself at his polling place and, shall be permitted to vote
9  upon presenting himself at his regular polling place in the same
10  manner as he could have voted had he not received an absentee
11  ballot: Provided, That such elector has first presented himself
12  to the judge of elections in his local election district and
13  shall have signed the affidavit on the absentee voter's
14  temporary registration card, which affidavit shall be in
15  substantially the following form:
16     I hereby swear that I am a qualified registered elector who
17  has obtained an absentee ballot, however, I am present in the
18  [county] municipality of my residence and physically able to
19  present myself at my polling place and therefore request that my
20  absentee ballot be voided.

24       (Local Judge of Elections)
25     An elector who has received an absentee ballot under the
26  emergency application provisions of section 1302.1, and for
27  whom, therefore, no temporary absentee voter's registration card
28  is in the district register, shall sign the aforementioned
29  affidavit in any case, which the local judge of elections shall
30  then cause to be inserted in the district register with the
1  elector's permanent registration card.
2     Section 1308.  Canvassing of Official Absentee Ballots.--
3     * * *
4     (e)  At such time the local election board shall then further
5  examine the declaration on each envelope not so set aside and
6  shall compare the information thereon with that contained in the
7  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and
8  the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters
9  File." If the local election board is satisfied that the
10  declaration is sufficient and the information contained in the
11  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and
12  the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters
13  File" verifies his right to vote, the local election board shall
14  announce the name of the elector and shall give any watcher
15  present an opportunity to challenge any absentee elector upon
16  the ground or grounds (1) that the absentee elector is not a
17  qualified elector; or (2) that the absentee elector was within
18  the [county] municipality of his residence on the day of the
19  primary or election during the period the polls were open,
20  except where he was in military service or except in the case
21  where his ballot was obtained for the reason that he was unable
22  to appear personally at the polling place because of illness or
23  physical disability; or (3) that the absentee elector was able
24  to appear personally at the polling place on the day of the
25  primary or election during the period the polls were open in the
26  case his ballot was obtained for the reason that he was unable
27  to appear personally at the polling place because of illness or
28  physical disability. Upon challenge of any absentee elector, as
29  set forth herein the local election board shall mark
30  "challenged" on the envelope together with the reason or reasons
1  therefor, and the same shall be set aside for return to the
2  county board unopened pending decision by the county board and
3  shall not be counted. All absentee ballots not challenged for
4  any of the reasons provided herein shall be counted and included
5  with the general return of paper ballots or voting machines, as
6  the case may be as follows. Thereupon, the local election board
7  shall open the envelope of every unchallenged absentee elector
8  in such manner as not to destroy the declaration executed
9  thereon. All of such envelopes on which are printed, stamped or
10  endorsed the words "Official Absentee Ballot" shall be placed in
11  one or more depositories at one time and said depository or
12  depositories well shaken and the envelopes mixed before any
13  envelope is taken therefrom. If any of these envelopes shall
14  contain any extraneous marks or identifying symbols other than
15  the words "Official Absentee Ballot," the envelopes and the
16  ballots contained therein shall be set aside and declared void.
17  The local election board shall then break the seals of such
18  envelopes, remove the ballots and record the votes in the same
19  manner as district election officers are required to record
20  votes. With respect to the challenged ballots, they shall be
21  returned to the county board with the returns of the local
22  election district where they shall be placed unopened in a
23  secure, safe and sealed container in the custody of the county
24  board until it shall fix a time and place for a formal hearing
25  of all such challenges and notice shall be given where possible
26  to all absentee electors thus challenged and to every attorney,
27  watcher or candidate who made such challenge. The time for the
28  hearing shall not be later than seven (7) days after the date of
29  said challenge. On the day fixed for said hearing, the county
30  board shall proceed without delay to hear said challenges and,
1  in hearing the testimony, the county board shall not be bound by
2  technical rules of evidence. The testimony presented shall be
3  stenographically recorded and made part of the record of the
4  hearing. The decision of the county board in upholding or
5  dismissing any challenge may be reviewed by the court of common
6  pleas of the county upon a petition filed by any person
7  aggrieved by the decision of the county board. Such appeal shall
8  be taken, within two (2) days after such decision shall have
9  been made, whether reduced to writing or not, to the court of
10  common pleas setting forth the objections to the county board's
11  decision and praying for an order reversing same. Pending the
12  final determination of all appeals, the county board shall
13  suspend any action in canvassing and computing all challenged
14  ballots irrespective of whether or not appeal was taken from the
15  county board's decision. Upon completion of the computation of
16  the returns of the county, the votes cast upon the challenged
17  official absentee ballots shall be added to the other votes cast
18  within the county.
