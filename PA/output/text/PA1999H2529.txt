28  shall have recovered from his illness or physical disability
29  sufficiently to permit him to present himself at the proper
30  polling place for the purpose of casting his ballot, such
1  absentee ballot cast by such elector shall, be declared void.
2     Any such elector referred to in this subsection, who is
3  within the municipality of his residence, must present himself

8  to the judge of elections in his local election district and
9  shall have signed the affidavit on the absentee voter's
10  temporary registration card, which affidavit shall be in
11  substantially the following form:
12     I hereby swear that I am a qualified registered elector who
13  has obtained an absentee ballot, however, I am present in the
14  municipality of my residence and physically able to present
15  myself at my polling place and therefore request that my
16  absentee ballot be voided.

26  then cause to be inserted in the district register with the
27  elector's permanent registration card.
