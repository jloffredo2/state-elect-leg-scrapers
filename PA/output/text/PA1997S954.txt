22     (t.1)  The words "recall election" shall mean an election
23  held in conjunction with a regularly scheduled general or
1  municipal election for the purpose of allowing the voters to
2  remove an elected Senator or Representative of the General

5     Section 2.  The act is amended by adding a section to read:
6     Section 638.  Recall of Members of General Assembly.--(a)
7  Except as provided in subsection (c), a member of the General
8  Assembly is subject to recall from office at any time by the
9  eligible electors entitled to vote for a successor to the
10  incumbent.
11     (b)  Eligible electors of a legislative district may initiate
12  the recall of a member of the General Assembly by signing a
13  petition which demands the removal of the officer to be recalled
14  named in the petition. The petition shall contain a general
15  statement, consisting of two hundred (200) words or less,
16  stating the ground or grounds on which the recall is sought and
17  grounds shall not be open to review.
18     (c)  No recall petition shall be circulated or filed against
19  any member of the General Assembly until the officer has
20  actually held office for at least six (6) months. A recall
21  petition shall not be filed during the year in which the officer
22  to be recalled would be eligible for reelection.
23     (d)  The county may charge those filing the recall petition a
24  reasonable administrative fee for the filing and review of the
25  recall petition.
26     (e)  A petition to recall an officer shall be signed by the
27  eligible electors of the legislative district equal in number to
28  at least thirty per centum of those electors who voted for the
29  office for which the higher number of votes was cast in the
30  election at which the officer to be recalled was elected. In no
1  case shall the number required for recall be less than ten per
2  centum of eligible electors qualified to vote in the most recent
3  election. Signatures must be obtained within ninety (90) days of
4  the date which the petition was first circulated for signatures.
5  Only an eligible elector may circulate a recall petition or be a
6  signatory of a recall petition. The county election official in
7  which the legislative district is located shall then submit the
8  measure at the next general or municipal election held at least
9  ninety (90) days after it qualifies. Upon certification, the
10  county election officials shall notify by registered mail the
11  officer to be recalled.
12     (f)  If a majority of voters voting on the recall election
13  question vote "yes" for removal, then a replacement shall be
14  named in accordance with this act. If the majority of the voters
15  voting on the recall election question vote "no" for removal,
16  then the officer may serve the remainder of his term.
17     (g)  As used in this section:
18     (1)  The words "eligible elector" shall mean a registered
19  voter who resides in the legislative district in which the
20  officer to be recalled serves. The "eligible elector" must have
21  voted in the most recent election in which the officer to be
22  recalled was elected.
23     (2)  The words "officer to be recalled" shall mean the member
24  of the General Assembly who has served at least six months
25  following the member's election as a Senator or Representative.
26     Section 3.  If a constitutional amendment authorizing the
27  recall of an individual holding office as a member of the
28  General Assembly is ratified, the Secretary of the Commonwealth
29  shall immediately after tabulating and computing the results of
30  the ratification election certify the result to the Legislative
1  Reference Bureau for publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin.
2     Section 4.  This act shall take effect as follows:
3         (1)  The amendment or addition of sections 102 and 638 of
4     the act shall take effect upon the publication of the
5     certification under section 3 of this act.
6         (2)  The remainder of this act shall take effect
7     immediately.
