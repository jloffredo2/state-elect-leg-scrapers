6  such excess shall be deemed a discrepancy and palpable error,
7  and shall be investigated by the return board, and no votes
8  shall be recorded from such district until such investigation
9  shall be had, and such excess shall authorize--(a) the summoning
10  of the election officers, overseers, machine inspectors, and
11  clerks to appear forthwith with any election papers in their
12  possession; (b) the production of the ballot box before the
13  return board, and the examination and scrutiny of all of its

15  whatever, relating to said district, in the presence of
16  representatives of each party and candidate interested who are
17  attending the canvass of such votes; and the recount of the
18  ballots contained in said ballot box, either generally or
19  respecting the particular office, nomination, or question as to
20  which the excess exists, in the discretion of the return board;
21  (c) the correction of the returns in accordance with the result
22  of said recount; (d) in the discretion of the return board, the
23  exclusion of the poll of that district, either as to all
24  offices, candidates, questions, and parties, or as to any
25  particular offices, candidates, questions, or parties as to
26  which said excess exists, if the ballot box be found to contain
27  more ballots than there are electors registered or enrolled in
28  said election district, [or more ballots of one party than there
29  are electors registered or enrolled in said district as members
30  of that party,] or more ballots than the number of voters who
1  voted at said election[, or more ballots of one party than the
2  number of voters of that party who voted at said election]; (e)
3  a report of the facts of the case to the district attorney where
4  such action appears to be warranted.
