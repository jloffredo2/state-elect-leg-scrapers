24  absentee ballots within five days of the county board's receipt

29  unresolved objection to a nomination petition or paper filed
30  pursuant to section 977, the withdrawal or death of a candidate
1  for nomination or election, failure of the Secretary of the
2  Commonwealth to transmit a certified list of nominees to the

4  outside the control of the board, the county board of elections
5  shall mail or deliver the absentee ballots no later than five
6  days following the resolution of the matter that has caused the
7  noncompliance with the deadline.
