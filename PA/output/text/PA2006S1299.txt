15     Section 1.  Section 1111-A of the act of June 3, 1937
16  (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code,
17  added July 11, 1980 (P.L.600, No.128), is amended to read:
18     Section 1111-A.  Instruction of Voters.--(a)  During the
19  thirty days next preceding an election at which any electronic
20  voting system is to be used, the county board of elections shall
21  place on public exhibition, in such public places and in such
22  quantity and at such times as it shall deem most suitable for
1  the instruction and information of the voters of the county,
2  those components of the electronic voting system which are used
3  by the voter, containing a sample ballot designed for
4  instructional use. Such components shall be under the charge and
5  care of a person competent as custodian and instructor. No
6  voting system component which is assigned for use in an election
7  shall be used for such public exhibition and instruction after
8  having been prepared and sealed for the election.

11  diagrams and a model, in the operation of the voting device
12  before he enters the voting booth and of the ability to complete
13  a paper ballot under section 1123-A. If any voter shall ask for
14  further instructions concerning the manner of voting after
15  entering the voting booth, any election officer may give him
16  audible instructions without entering such booth, but no such
17  election officer shall when giving such instructions in any
18  manner request, suggest or seek to persuade or induce any such
19  voter to vote any particular ticket or for any particular
20  candidate or other person or for or against any particular
21  question.
22     (c)  During the thirty days next preceding an election at
23  which any electronic voting system in which votes are registered
24  electronically is to be used, the county board of elections
25  shall conduct a public education program to inform voters of
26  their right to complete a paper ballot under section 1123-A. The
27  county board of elections shall place signs at each polling
28  place notifying voters of their right to complete a paper ballot
29  under section 1123-A.
30     Section 2.  The act is amended by adding a section to read:
1     Section 1123-A.  Right to Use Paper Ballots.--(a)
2  Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, a voter in an
3  election district which uses an electronic voting system in
4  which votes are registered electronically shall have the right
5  to complete a paper ballot under this section.
6     (b)  Paper ballots utilized under subsection (a) shall be
7  manually counted and shall not be entered into an electronic
8  voting system in any manner.
9     (c)  Paper ballots utilized under subsection (a) shall be
10  printed for any election or office and the election shall be
11  conducted by the election officers provided for in this act and
12  the ballots counted and the return of the ballots made in the
13  manner required by law for such offices insofar as paper ballots
14  are used.
15     Section 3.  The following provisions shall apply to elections
