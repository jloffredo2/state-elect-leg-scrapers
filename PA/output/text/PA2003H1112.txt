11  within 60 days of receiving notice of the death of an individual
12  18 years of age or older, send the] report to the registration
13  commission within 30 days of the last day of each calendar month
14  the deaths of residents of such counties, except residents under
1  18 years of age, for that month. Such report shall include the
2  full name and last address of residence of that individual [to a
3  commission], the date of his birth, if available, and the date
4  of death in a manner and on a form prescribed by the department.
5  The commission shall promptly update information contained in
6  its registration records to reflect the death of the registered
7  elector and the cancellation of his registration.
8     (b)  Other sources.--A commission may also utilize published
9  newspaper obituaries, letters testamentary or letters of
10  administration issued by the office of the registrar of wills to
11  cancel and remove the registration of an elector, provided that
12  such removals are uniform, nondiscriminatory and in compliance
13  with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Public Law 89-110, 42 U.S.C.
14  ยง 1973 et seq.). The commission shall promptly update
15  information contained in its registration records.
16     (c)  Corrections.--An individual incorrectly reported
17  deceased by the Department of Health or incorrectly removed by a
18  commission for reason of death may appear in person before a
19  commissioner, registrar or clerk at the office of the commission
20  and prove identity. The commission, upon such proof, shall
21  correct its registration records.
22     (d)  Removal of commissioners for nonfeasance.--In the event
23  the Bureau of Commissions, Elections and Legislation determines
24  that the registration commission of any county has failed to
25  timely cancel the registration of any person reported to it as
26  deceased by the Department of Health, such failure shall
27  constitute nonfeasance in office and upon notification to the
28  registration commission each commissioner shall be deemed as
29  removed from office immediately. The president judge of the
30  court of common pleas shall fill each vacancy by appointing a
1  judge or an elector of the county to serve as an interim
2  registration commissioner for the remainder of the term.
3     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
