7  base containing the names of all registered electors in this
8  Commonwealth along with the corresponding data elements required

11  information required to be on a registration card. The data base
12  shall be contained on a central computer in a location to be
13  designated by the secretary. County commissions may continue to
14  maintain their existing systems and data bases as the primary
15  files of registered eligible voters for their respective
16  counties, producing all required election materials, including
17  district registers and street lists, from the county data base.
18  All county voter registration commissions shall be linked
19  electronically to the system. County commissions may update
20  their respective county voter registration records in the
21  central registry data base by electronic downloads from their
22  county data bases, or they may choose to use their files in the
23  central registry as the primary files of eligible voters for
24  their respective county, and then update their respective voter
25  registration records by direct entry into the central registry.
26  The data base shall be developed in consultation with the county
27  commissions and shall as far as practicable be compatible with
28  current software programs utilized by the counties that are
29  necessary for voter registration and election administration
30  which are dependent upon and operate from any voter registration
1  data base utilized by the county, provided however, that the
2  secretary shall have the authority to prescribe record format
3  for the integrated voter registration data base and system. The
4  timetable for implementation of the system shall be established
5  by the secretary no later than three years after this subsection
6  takes effect unless otherwise approved by the General Assembly.
7  The secretary may phase in the use of the system on a county-by-
8  county basis, provided however that no county shall use the
9  registry for any purpose authorized by this act until the
10  secretary shall certify that all proper tests have been
11  conducted insuring that the system as established in the county
12  is capable of performing according to all requirements of this
13  act.
14     (b)  Functions.--The integrated voter registration system
15  shall include, but not be limited to, provisions which do all of

15     access to the registry for review and search capabilities to
16     permit viewing by the secretary and commissions of all
17     registration records of all commissions in order to maintain
18     the accuracy of the files, except that no county shall be
19     able to make any transaction permitted by this act to alter
20     any voter registration except for those registrants resident
21     in their county.
22         (8)  Allow the secretary to access the computerized
23     driver's license records of the Department of Transportation

20         (1)  If the commission finds the official registration
21     application not properly completed, the application shall be
22     rejected. The commission should make reasonable efforts to
23     complete the registration before rejecting it for omissions
24     and inconsistencies. If the commission rejects an application
25     under this paragraph, it shall indicate "REJECTED" on the
26     application and state there the reason for rejection and
27     notify the applicant by first class nonforwardable mail,
28     return postage guaranteed. Rejected registration applications
29     filed electronically shall be preserved on the integrated
30     voter registration system, and the system shall provide the

12     required information and the applicant is legally qualified
13     to transfer registration or change name or address as stated
14     in the application, the commission shall make the transfer or
15     change. If the commission suspects that the applicant is not
16     entitled to transfer registration or to change name or
17     address, the commission may investigate. If the commission
18     finds that the applicant is not entitled to the transfer or
19     change, the application shall be rejected. The applicant
20     shall be notified of the rejection and the reason for it.
21     Rejection shall be made no later than ten days before the
22     election succeeding the filing of the application.
23     (c)  Result.--[If an] Until such time as the commission is
24  able to use or approves the use of the central registry for the
25  administration of voter registration pursuant to this act, if a
26  voter registration application is designed to serve as a
27  registration card, the accepted application of an elector may
28  serve as the elector's official registration card, if it was so
29  designed, and shall be filed in the office of the commission in
30  accordance with Chapter 7. If the application is not designed to
1  serve as a registration card, the information contained on the
2  application, including the elector's signature, shall be
3  transferred to the registration card. If a commission utilizes a
4  signature digitization list, it shall transfer all information
5  contained on the application, including the signature, to the
6  registry or, until the registry is established, to a computer
7  file. Once the commission is connected to the integrated voter
8  registration system, the information contained on an approved
9  voter registration application including the elector's signature
10  may be entered directly into the registry or downloaded from the
11  commission's local data base into the registry, at the county's
12  option. If an application has been submitted electronically,
13  once it has been approved by the commission, the commission
14  shall make it a permanent record of the registry. The system
15  shall include equipment and software for use by the commission
16  to print a paper copy and process it according to section
17  702(b)(1). Applicants for registration shall be challenged under
18  section 529.

23  county as the district register, the duplicate registration
24  cards or photocopies of the original registration cards shall be
25  placed in exact alphabetical order by last name of the
26  registrant, shall be indexed and shall be kept at the office of
27  the registration commission in a manner as to be properly
28  safeguarded. These cards constitute the general register of the
29  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
30  commission except upon order of a court of record. Nothing in
1  this act shall preclude the use of duplicate registration cards
2  from applications provided under the act of March 30, 1937
3  (P.L.115, No.40), known as The First Class City Permanent
4  Registration Act, or the act of April 29, 1937 (P.L.487,

6  the Second Class, Cities of the Second Class A, Cities of the
7  Third Class, Boroughs, Towns, and Townships.
8     (b)  Digitized signature lists.--If a commission uses
9  digitized signature lists as the district register, the original
10  registration cards shall be placed in exact alphabetical order
11  by last name of the registrant, indexed and kept at the office
12  of the commission in a manner as to be properly safeguarded.
13  These original cards constitute the general register of the
14  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
15  commission except upon order of a court of record. The
16  commission shall safely retain all registration cards used in
17  the registration of electors or in conducting an election. If a
18  commission has the capability to accept an electronic
19  application, the secretary may require the commission to produce
20  a computer-generated card to file in the general register. If
21  the commission finds a record for a registrant on the computer
22  data base which is not contained in the general register, it
23  shall replace the original card with a computer-generated
24  duplicate card upon written permission from the registrant or
25  upon order of a court of record.
26     (c)  Duplicate files.--If the commission deems a duplicate
27  file of registration cards necessary for administrative
28  purposes, the commission may prepare a reproduction in
29  compliance with the following:
30         (1)  The registration form shall be photographed,
1     microphotographed or reproduced in a manner approved for
2     permanent records by the secretary.
3         (2)  The device used to reproduce the card is one which
4     accurately reproduces the original in all details.
5         (3)  The photographs, microphotographs or other
6     reproductions are open to public inspection and provision is
7     made for preserving, examining and using them.]
8     The registration records of those registrants in the county
9  contained on the registry may be the general registry of each
10  county and may be used by the commission for preparation of the
11  district register.

30  Section 1901.  Removal of voters.
1     * * *
2     (b)  Voter removal program.--
3         (1)  The [commission] secretary shall establish [a] the
4     following program to identify electors whose address may have
5     changed by establishing one of the following programs:
6             (i)  National change of address. The secretary shall
7         establish by regulation a program whereby information
8         supplied by the United States Postal Service through its
9         licensees is used on a periodic basis, but not less than
10         once every calendar year, to identify electors who may
11         have changed addresses. [The information shall be
12         incorporated in the administration of the Statewide
13         central registry and shall be forwarded to the
14         commissions in a manner determined by the secretary by
15         regulation.] The secretary shall purchase the information
16         from a licensee in accordance with contracting
17         procedures. The secretary shall conduct the comparative
18         search of names on the list against registered electors
19         not marked inactive in accordance with subsection (c) and
20         the registry at least once every year and notify each
21         county via the integrated voter registration system of
22         those electors who should receive a notice specified in
23         clause (A). The secretary shall be responsible for
24         covering all costs associated with the national change of
25         address program. A commission that maintains its local
26         county data base as the primary file of eligible voters
27         may, at the commission's option, conduct the national
28         change of address program locally by contracting with a
29         licensed vendor.
30                 (A)  If it appears from the information provided
1             through the United States Postal Service that an
2             elector has moved to a different residence address
3             within the same county as the elector is currently
4             registered, the commission shall change the
5             registration records to show the new address and
6             shall send the elector, to the address recorded on
7             the elector's registration, a notice of the change of
8             address by forwardable mail and a postage prepaid,
9             preaddressed return form by which the elector may
10             verify or correct the address information.
11                 (B)  If it appears from the information provided
12             through the United States Postal Service that an
13             elector has moved to a different residence address
14             outside the county, the commission shall use the
15             notice procedure described in [clause (A)] subsection
16             (d)(2).
17             (ii)  Confirmation mailing:
18                 (A)  [A] In addition to using the programs
19             specified in subparagraph (i), a commission may
20             establish a program by sending a direct,
21             nonforwardable first class "return if undeliverable -
22             address correction requested" mailing to all
23             registered electors in the county not marked as
24             inactive in accordance with subsection (c) at least
25             once every five years.
26                 (B)  If this program is established, the
27             commission shall use the notice procedure described
28             in subparagraph (i)(A) for any elector whose mailing
29             is returned undeliverable.
30         (2)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
1     program established under paragraph (1), a canvass may be
2     used as follows:
3             (i)  The registration commission may, by
4         commissioners or by inspectors of registration, verify
5         the registration in an election district by visiting the
6         building from which an elector is registered and other
7         buildings as the commission deems necessary.
8             (ii)  The commission shall make a record of the name
9         and address of each registered elector who is found not
10         to reside at the registered address or who for any other
11         reason appears to be not qualified to vote in the
12         registered election district.
13             (iii)  The commission shall leave at the address of
14         each person referred to in subparagraph (ii) a notice
15         requiring him to communicate with the commission on or
16         before a date which the commission shall designate, and
17         which shall be not less than seven days and not more than
18         15 days from the date of the notice and in any case not
19         later than the 15th day preceding the election next
20         ensuing, and satisfy the commission of his qualifications
21         as an elector. The commission shall cause a confirmation
22         of each such notice to be sent by mail promptly to such
23         person at the address from which he is registered. The
24         envelope containing such information is to be plainly
25         marked that it is not to be forwarded. At the expiration
26         of the time specified in the notice, the commission shall
27         cancel the registration of such person who has not
28         communicated with the commission and proved his
29         qualifications as an elector.
30             (iv)  To facilitate the canvass under this section,
1         the commission may, when necessary, appoint special
2         inspectors of registration, in number not exceeding
3         double the number of election districts being canvassed.
4             (v)  Special inspectors must be qualified electors of
5         the county. They shall be appointed without reference to
6         residence in election districts or to political
7         affiliations or beliefs. The commission shall instruct
8         special inspectors in their duties. Special inspectors
9         have the powers conferred by this act upon inspectors of
10         registration.
11         (3)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
12     program established under paragraph (1), the commission shall
13     send a notice pursuant to subsection (d) to any elector who
14     has not voted nor appeared to vote during the period
15     beginning five years before the date of the notice and ending
16     on the date of the notice and for whom the board of elections
17     did not during that period in any other way receive any
18     information that the voter still resides in the registered
19     election district.
20         (4)  [Commissions] The secretary and commissions shall
21     complete, not later than 90 days before each primary[, at
22     least once per year] or election, the voter removal programs
23     under this section. This paragraph shall not be construed to
24     preclude any of the following:
25             (i)  Cancellation of an elector's registration as
26         provided for under subsection (a)(1) or (2).
27             (ii)  Correction of registration records in
28         accordance with this act.
29     (c)  Identification of inactive voters.--A commission shall
30  mark an "I" or "inactive" on the registration card of each
1  elector who has been mailed a form under subsection (b)(1) or
2  (3) and has failed to respond[, which]. The registration record
3  of each registered elector classified as inactive shall be
4  included with all other registration cards for that polling site
5  and located at the individual's polling site on the day of the
6  election but may be contained on a list separate from electors
7  not marked inactive.
