12     Section 5.  Section 977 of the act, amended February 13, 1998
13  (P.L.72, No.18), is amended to read:
14     Section 977.  Objections to Nomination Petitions and
15  Papers.--All nomination petitions and papers received and filed
16  within the periods limited by this act shall be deemed to be
17  valid, unless, within seven days after the last day for filing
18  said nomination petition or paper, a petition is presented to
19  the court specifically setting forth the objections thereto, and
20  praying that the said petition or paper be set aside. A copy of
21  said petition shall, within said period, be served on the
22  officer or board with whom said nomination petition or paper was
23  filed. Upon the presentation of such a petition, the court shall
24  make an order fixing a time for hearing which shall not be later
25  than ten days after the last day for filing said nomination
26  petition or paper, and specifying the time and manner of notice
27  that shall be given to the candidate or candidates named in the
28  nomination petition or paper sought to be set aside. On the day
29  fixed for said hearing, the court shall proceed without delay to
30  hear said objections, and shall give such hearing precedence
1  over other business before it, and shall finally determine said
2  matter not later than fifteen (15) days after the last day for
3  filing said nomination petitions or papers. If the court shall
4  find that said nomination petition or paper is defective under
5  the provisions of section 976, or does not contain a sufficient
6  number of genuine signatures of electors entitled to sign the
7  same under the provisions of this act, or was not filed by
8  persons entitled to file the same, it shall be set aside. If the
9  objections relate to material errors or defects apparent on the
10  face of the nomination petition or paper, the court, after
11  hearing, may, in its discretion, permit amendments within such
12  time and upon such terms as to payment of costs, as the said
13  court may specify. In case any such petition is dismissed, the
14  court shall make such order as to the payment of the costs of
15  the proceedings, including witness fees, as it shall deem just.
16  Appeals of decisions on objection cases must be filed within two
17  (2) business days of the filing of such a decision. In the event
18  of an appeal, the court from which the appeal is taken shall
19  transmit the record to the appellate court as soon as
20  practicable. If a person shall sign any nomination petitions or
21  papers for a greater number of candidates than he is permitted
22  under the provisions of this act, if said signatures bear the
23  same date, they shall, upon objections filed thereto, not be
24  counted on any petition or paper and if they bear different
25  dates, they shall be counted in the order of their priority of
26  date, for only so many persons as there are candidates to be
27  nominated or elected. The office of the Prothonotary of the
28  Commonwealth Court and the office of the Secretary of the
29  Commonwealth and the various offices of prothonotary of the
30  court of common pleas shall be open between the hours of eight-
1  thirty o'clock A.M. and five o'clock P.M. on the last day to
2  withdraw after filing nomination petitions and on the last day
3  to file objections to nomination petitions.
4     Section 6.  The act is amended by adding a section to read:
5     Section 982.1.  Furnishing List of All Nominated Candidates
6  to the Public.--(a)  It shall be the duty of the Secretary of
7  the Commonwealth, prior to each primary and general election, to
8  compile a list of all candidates appearing on the ballot in a
9  primary or general election for each county in this
10  Commonwealth.
11     (b)  To assist the Secretary of the Commonwealth in compiling
12  this list of candidates, it shall be the duty of all county
13  boards to send to the Secretary of the Commonwealth, in a manner
14  directed by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, notice setting
15  forth all candidates for all offices appearing on the ballot in
16  that primary or general election for their respective counties.
17  If the county fails to send the Secretary of the Commonwealth
18  the notice under this subsection at least ten (10) days prior to
19  the applicable deadline in subsection (c), the secretary shall
20  withhold any reimbursements or payments owed to the county under
21  section 305 until such time as the secretary receives the
22  notice.
23     (c)  The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall develop a filing
24  system for the submission, retrieval, storage and public
25  disclosure of the list of all the candidates in both the primary
26  and November election and make available to anyone the list of
27  candidates in comma delimited text, database, spreadsheet or
28  printed formats. The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall further
29  provide the public with access to the list of all candidates
30  appearing on the ballot in the primary or the general election
1  no later than thirty (30) days prior to the primary election and
2  within thirty (30) days following the primary election, the
3  names of the winning candidates shall be posted. The Department
4  of State shall not charge any fee for access to the list of
5  candidates. The department has the discretion to determine the
6  most efficient means of providing access to the list of all the
7  candidates. Access to the list of the candidates submitted to
8  the Secretary of the Commonwealth shall be made available via
9  the Internet or upon request of the Department of State.
10     Section 7.  Section 1107-A of the act, added July 11, 1980
11  (P.L.600, No.128), is amended to read:
12     Section 1107-A.  Requirements of Electronic Voting Systems.--
13  No electronic voting system shall, upon any examination or
14  reexamination, be approved by the Secretary of the Commonwealth,
15  or by any examiner appointed by him, unless it shall be
16  established that such system, at the time of such examination or
17  reexamination:
18     (1)  Provides for voting in absolute secrecy and prevents any
19  person from seeing or knowing for whom any voter, except one who
20  has received or is receiving assistance as prescribed by law,
21  has voted or is voting.
22     (2)  Provides facilities for voting for such candidates as
23  may be nominated and upon such questions as may be submitted.
24     (3)  [Permits] If it is of a type that uses paper ballots or
25  ballot cards to register the vote and automatic tabulating
26  equipment to compute such vote, permits each voter, at other
27  than primary elections, to vote a straight political party
28  ticket by one mark or act and, by one mark or act, to vote for
29  all the candidates of one political party for presidential
30  electors and, by one mark or act, to vote for all the candidates
1  of one political party for every office to be voted for, and
2  every such mark or act shall be equivalent to and shall be
3  counted as a vote for every candidate of the political party so
4  marked including its candidates for presidential electors,
5  except with respect to those offices as to which the voter has
6  registered a vote for individual candidates of the same or
7  another political party or political body, in which case the
8  automatic tabulating equipment shall credit the vote for that
9  office only for the candidate individually so selected,
10  notwithstanding the fact that the voter may not have
11  individually voted for the full number of candidates for that
12  office for which he was entitled to vote.
13     (3.1)  If the electronic voting system is of the type that
14  registers the vote electronically, permits each voter, at other
15  than primary elections, to vote a straight political party
16  ticket in one operation; in one operation to vote for all the
17  candidates of one political party for presidential electors; and
18  in one operation, to vote for all the candidates of one
19  political party for every office to be voted for, except those
20  offices as to which the voter votes for individual candidates.
21     (4)  Permits each voter, at other than primary elections, to
22  vote a ticket selected from the nominees of any and all
23  political parties, from the nominees of any and all political
24  bodies, and from any persons whose names are not in nomination
25  and do not appear upon the official ballot.
26     (5)  Permits each voter to vote for any person and any office
27  for whom and for which he is lawfully entitled to vote, whether
28  or not the name of such person appears upon the ballot as a
29  candidate for nomination or election.
30     (6)  Permits each voter to vote for as many persons for any
1  office as he is entitled to vote for and to vote for or against
2  any question upon which he is entitled to vote and precludes
3  each voter from voting or from having his vote tabulated for any
4  candidate, or upon any question, for whom or upon which he is
5  not entitled to vote.
6     (7)  If it is of a type that registers the vote
7  electronically, the voting system shall preclude each voter from
8  voting for more persons for any office than he is entitled to
9  vote for or upon any question more than once.
10     (8)  Precludes each voter from voting or from having his vote
11  tabulated more than once for any candidate for the same office
12  or upon any question, except in districts and for offices where
13  cumulative voting is authorized by law.
14     (9)  Permits each voter at a primary election to vote only
15  for the candidates seeking nomination by a political party in
16  which such voter is registered and enrolled, and for any
17  candidate for nonpartisan nomination, and for any question upon
18  which he is entitled to vote.
19     (10)  If it is of a type that registers the vote
20  electronically, the voting system shall permit each voter to
21  change his vote for any candidate or upon any question appearing
22  on the official ballot up to the time that he takes the final
23  step to register his vote and to have his vote computed. If it
24  is of a type that uses paper ballots or ballot cards to register
25  the vote and automatic tabulating equipment to compute such
26  votes, the system shall provide that a voter who spoils his
27  ballot may obtain another ballot; any ballot thus returned shall
28  be immediately cancelled and at the close of the polls shall be
29  enclosed in an envelope marked "spoiled" which shall be sealed
30  and returned to the county board.
1     (11)  Is suitably designed for the purpose used, is
2  constructed in a neat and workmanlike manner of durable material
3  of good quality, is safely and efficiently useable in the
4  conduct of elections and, with respect to the counting of
5  ballots cast at each district, is suitably designed and equipped
6  to be capable of absolute accuracy, which accuracy shall be
7  demonstrated to the Secretary of the Commonwealth.
8     (12)  Provides acceptable ballot security procedures and
9  impoundment of ballots to prevent tampering with or substitution
10  of any ballots or ballot cards.
11     (13)  When properly operated, records correctly and computes
12  and tabulates accurately every valid vote registered.
13     (14)  Is safely transportable.
14     (15)  Is so constructed that a voter may readily learn the
15  method of operating it.
16     (16)  If the voting system is of a type which provides for
17  the computation and tabulation of votes at the district level,
18  the district component of the automatic tabulating equipment
19  shall include the following mechanisms or capabilities:
20     (i)  A public counter, the register of which is visible from
21  the outside of the automatic tabulating equipment component into
22  which the ballots are entered, which shall show during any
23  period of operation the total number of ballots entered for
24  computation and tabulation.
25     (ii)  A lock, or locks, by the use of which all operation of
26  the tabulation element of the automatic tabulating equipment is
27  absolutely prevented immediately after the polls are closed or
28  where the tabulation of votes is completed.
29     (iii)  It shall be so constructed and controlled that, during
30  the progress of voting, it shall preclude every person from
1  seeing or knowing the number of votes theretofore registered for
2  any candidate or question; and it shall preclude every person
3  from tampering with the tabulating element.
4     (iv)  If the number of choices recorded for any office or on
5  any question exceeds the number for which the voter is entitled
6  to vote, it shall reject all choices recorded on the ballot for
7  that office or question, provided, that if used during the
8  period of voting it may also have the capacity to indicate to a
9  voter that he has improperly voted for more candidates for any
10  office than he is entitled to vote for, and in such case it
11  shall have the capacity to permit the voter to mark a new ballot
12  or to forego his opportunity to make such correction.
13     (v)  It shall be equipped with an element which generates a
14  printed record at the beginning of its operation which verifies
15  that the tabulating elements for each candidate position and
16  each question and the public counter are all set to zero and
17  with an element which generates a printed record at the finish
18  of its operation of the total number of voters whose ballots
19  have been tabulated, the total number of votes cast for each
20  candidate whose name appears on the ballot, and the total number
21  of votes cast for, or against, any question appearing on the
22  ballot.
23     (17)  If the voting system is of a type which provides for
24  the computation and tabulation of all votes at a central
25  counting center or if it provides for the tabulation of district
26  totals at such a central counting center, the central automatic
27  tabulating equipment shall include the following mechanisms or
28  capabilities:
29     (i)  It shall be constructed so that every person is
30  precluded from tampering with the tabulating element during the
1  course of its operation.
2     (ii)  If the number of choices for any office or on any
3  question exceeds the number for which the voter is entitled to
4  vote, it shall reject all choices recorded on the ballot for
5  that office or question.
6     (iii)  It shall have a means by which to verify that the
7  counters for each candidate position and for each question are
8  all set to zero and shall be able to generate a printed record
9  of each election district showing the total number of voters
10  whose ballots have been tabulated, the total number of votes
11  cast for each candidate whose name appears on the ballot, and
12  the total number of votes cast for, or against, any question
13  appearing on the ballot. It may also be capable of generating
14  cumulative election reports.
15     Section 8.  Section 1202 of the act is amended to read:
16     Section 1202.  Cards of Instructions and Supplies.--Prior to
17  each primary and election each county board of election shall
18  prepare full instructions for the guidance of electors in
19  districts in which ballots are used, and also similar
20  instructions for the guidance of electors in districts in which
21  voting machines are used, and they shall cause the same,
22  together with such portions of this act as deemed advisable, to
23  be printed in large clear type on separate cards to be called
24  cards of instruction. Each county board of election shall insure
25  that an adequate supply of provisional ballots numbering no less
26  than an amount equal to ten (10) per centum of the electors
27  registered in the election district is available. They shall
28  also prepare blank forms of oaths of election officers, records
29  of assisted voters, affidavits of challenged electors and
30  others, general and duplicate return sheets, tally papers,
1  statements, blank forms for numbered lists of voters, with
2  sufficient space for noting their party enrollment at primaries,
3  notice of penalties for the information of electors and election
4  officers, and other forms and supplies required by this act for
5  use in each election district of the county. Said forms, blank
6  books, and other supplies shall have printed thereon appropriate
7  instructions. In districts in which voting machines are used the
8  general and duplicate return sheets and statement shall be
9  printed to conform to the type of voting machine used in such
10  districts and the designating number and letter, if any, on the
11  counter for each candidate shall be printed thereon opposite the
12  candidate's name.
13     Section 9.  Section 1302 of the act, amended February 13,
14  1998 (P.L.72, No.18) and December 9, 2002 (P.L.1246, No.150) is

17  required to file a physician's certificate of disability with
18  each application as required in subsection (e) of this section
19  but such person must submit a written statement asserting
20  continuing disability every four years in order to maintain his
21  eligibility to vote under the provisions of this subsection.
22  Should any such person lose his disability he shall inform the
23  county board of elections of the county of his residence.
24     (e.2)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this act any

5  of residence.
6     (f)  The county chairman of each political party or the head
7  of each political body shall designate one representative from

12  obtaining the names and addresses of public institution
13  residents who desire to receive applications for absentee
14  ballots and to act as an election board as provided in
15  subsection (g) of this section. The list of names and addresses
16  thus obtained shall then be submitted by said representatives to

3  shall be counted with the other absentee ballots, if any.
4     (h)  The county board of election shall number, in
5  chronological order, the applications for an official absentee
6  ballot, which number shall likewise appear on the official
7  absentee ballot for the qualified elector. The numbers shall
8  appear legibly and in a conspicuous place but before the ballots
9  are distributed the number on the ballot shall be torn off by
10  the county board of election. This number information shall be
11  appropriately inserted and become a part of the Registered
12  Absentee Voters File and the Military, Veterans and Emergency
13  Civilian Absentee Voters File provided in section 1302.3 of this
14  act.
15     (i)  Application for official absentee ballots shall be on
16  forms prescribed by the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The
17  application shall state that a voter who receives an absentee
18  ballot pursuant to section 1301 and who, on election day, is
19  capable of voting at the appropriate polling place must void the
20  absentee ballot and vote in the normal manner at the appropriate
21  voting place. Such forms shall be made freely available to the
22  public at county board of elections, municipal buildings and at
23  such other locations designated by the secretary. No written
24  application or personal request shall be necessary to receive

9  applicant is qualified to receive an official absentee ballot,
10  the application shall be marked approved such approval decision
11  shall be final and binding except that challenges may be made
12  only on the ground that the applicant did not possess

14  Challenges to applications received from qualified electors not
15  required to be registered under section 1301(i) must be made to
16  the county board of elections prior to 5:00 o'clock P. M. on the

24  Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters File as provided in section
25  1302.3, subsection (b): Providing, however, That no application
26  of any qualified elector in military service shall be rejected
27  for failure to include on his application any information if

29  the county board of elections.
30     (b) The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
1  application filed by a qualified elector who is entitled, under

5  provided under preceding section 1301, shall ascertain from the
6  information on such application or from any other source that
7  such applicant possesses all the qualifications of a qualified
8  elector. If the board is satisfied that the applicant is
9  entitled[, under the provisions of the Permanent Registration
10  Law as now or hereinafter enacted by the General Assembly,] to
11  absentee registration prior to or concurrently with the time of
12  voting and that the applicant is qualified to receive an
13  official absentee ballot, the application shall be marked
14  "approved." Such approval decision shall be final and binding
15  except that challenges may be made only on the ground that the
16  applicant did not possess the qualifications of an absentee
17  elector prior to or concurrently with the time of voting. Such
18  challenges must be made to the county board of elections prior
19  to [5:00 o'clock P. M. on the first Friday prior to] 8:00
20  o'clock P. M. on the day of the election. When so approved, the

24  Absentee Voters File as provided in section 1302.3 subsection
25  (b).
26     (c)  The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
27  application of a qualified elector required to be registered
28  under the provisions of preceding section 1301, shall determine
29  the qualifications of such applicant by comparing the
30  information set forth on such application with the information
1  contained on the applicant's permanent registration card. If the
2  board is satisfied that the applicant is qualified to receive an
3  official absentee ballot, the application shall be marked
4  "approved." Such approval decision shall be final and binding,
5  except that challenges may be made only on the ground that the
6  applicant did not possess the qualifications of an absentee
7  elector. Such challenges must be made to the county board of
8  elections prior to 5:00 o'clock P. M. on the first Friday prior
9  to the election. When so approved, the registration commission
10  shall cause an absentee voter's temporary registration card to
11  be inserted in the district register on top of and along with
12  the permanent registration card. The absentee voter's temporary
13  registration card shall be in the color and form prescribed in

18  any elector from the district register as set forth in section
19  1302.2 shall include only such applications and emergency
20  applications as are received on or before the first Tuesday
21  prior to the primary or election. In all cases where
22  applications are received after the first Tuesday prior to the
23  primary or election and before five o'clock P. M. on the first
24  Friday prior to the primary or election, the county board of
25  elections shall determine the qualifications of such applicant
26  by comparing the information set forth on such application with
27  the information contained on the applicant's duplicate
28  registration card on file in the General Register (also referred
29  to as the Master File) in the office of the Registration
30  Commission and shall cause the name and residence (and at

6  list of the election district of said elector's residence and
7  satisfy itself that such elector did not cast any ballot other
8  than the one properly issued to him under his absentee ballot
9  application. In all cases where the examination of the local
10  district board of elections discloses that an elector did vote a
11  ballot other than the one properly issued to him under the
12  absentee ballot application, the local district board of
13  elections shall thereupon cancel said absentee ballot and said
14  elector shall be subject to the penalties as hereinafter set
15  forth.
16     (d)  In the event that any application for an official
17  absentee ballot is not approved by the county board of
18  elections, the elector shall be notified immediately to that
19  effect with a statement by the county board of the reasons for
20  the disapproval.

22  be in duplicate and the same size as the permanent registration
23  card, in a different and contrasting color to the permanent
24  registration card and shall contain the absentee voter's name
25  and address and shall conspicuously contain the words "Absentee
26  Voter." Such card shall also contain the affidavit required by

30  containing the duplicate absentee voter's temporary registration
1  cards of every registered elector to whom an absentee ballot has
2  been sent. Such duplicate absentee voter's temporary

10     (4)  For those envelopes received from electors qualified in
11  accordance with section 1301(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g)

14  franked, or deliver it in person or by an individual authorized
15  representative of an elector specifically authorized to deliver
16  the elector's absentee ballot by a commercial delivery or

21     (a.1)  Any elector qualified in accordance with section
22  1301(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) may vote in any
23  election for any office by submitting a Federal Write-In
24  Absentee Ballot prescribed by the Uniformed and Overseas
25  Citizens Absentee Voting Act (Public Law 99-410, 100 Stat. 924).
26  The submission and processing of a Federal Write-In Absentee
27  Ballot shall be governed by section 103 of the Uniformed and
28  Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act or its successor and this
29  act.
30     (b)  In the event that any such elector, excepting an elector
1  in military service or any elector unable to go to his polling
2  place because of illness or physical disability, entitled to
3  vote an official absentee ballot shall be in the municipality of
4  his residence on the day for holding the primary or election for
5  which the ballot was issued, or in the event any such elector
6  shall have recovered from his illness or physical disability
7  sufficiently to permit him to present himself at the proper
8  polling place for the purpose of casting his ballot, such
9  absentee ballot cast by such elector shall, be declared void.
10     Any such elector referred to in this subsection, who is
11  within the municipality of his residence, must present himself
12  at his polling place and shall be permitted to vote upon
13  presenting himself at his regular polling place in the same
14  manner as he could have voted had he not received an absentee
15  ballot: Provided, That such elector has first presented himself
16  to the judge of elections in his local election district and
17  shall have signed the affidavit on the absentee voter's
18  temporary registration card, which affidavit shall be in
19  substantially the following form:
20     I hereby swear that I am a qualified registered elector who
21  has obtained an absentee ballot, however, I am present in the
22  municipality of my residence and physically able to present
23  myself at my polling place and therefore request that my
24  absentee ballot be voided.

28       (Local Judge of Elections)
29     An elector who has received an absentee ballot under the
30  emergency application provisions of section 1302.1, and for
1  whom, therefore, no temporary absentee voter's registration card
2  is in the district register, shall sign the aforementioned
3  affidavit in any case, which the local judge of elections shall
4  then cause to be inserted in the district register with the
5  elector's permanent registration card.
6     Section 13.  Section 1308 of the act, amended December 11,
7  1968 (P.L.1183, No.375), February 13, 1998 (P.L.72, No.18) and
8  December 9, 2002 (P.L.1246, No.150) and November 9, 2006
9  (P.L.1330, No.137), is amended to read:
10     Section 1308.  Canvassing of Official Absentee Ballots.--(a)
11  The county boards of election, upon receipt of official absentee
12  ballots in [such] official envelopes, shall safely keep the same
13  in sealed or locked containers until they distribute same to the
14  appropriate local election districts in a manner prescribed by
15  the Secretary of the Commonwealth.
16     Except as provided in section 1302.1(a.2), the county board
17  of elections shall then distribute the absentee ballots,
18  unopened, to the absentee voter's respective election district
19  concurrently with the distribution of the other election
20  supplies. Absentee ballots shall be canvassed immediately and
21  continuously without interruption until completed after the
22  close of the polls on the day of the election in each election
23  district. The results of the canvass of the absentee ballots
24  shall then be included in and returned to the county board with
25  the returns of that district. Except as provided in section
26  1302.1(a.2) and subsection (g), no absentee ballot shall be
27  counted which is received in the office of the county board of
28  election later than five o'clock P.M. on the Friday immediately
29  preceding the primary or November election[.], except that the
30  ballots received from electors qualified in accordance with
1  section 1301(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) shall be
2  canvassed if received by eight o'clock P. M. on the day of the
3  election or by the seventh day following the election if such
4  absentee ballot carries a postmark dated no later than the day
5  before the election.
6     (a.1)  Absentee ballots received from electors qualified in
7  accordance with section 1301(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g)
8  and (h) after the duplicate list was prepared and distributed to
9  the local election boards in accordance with section 1302.3(b.1)
10  and (c) but up until eight o'clock P. M. the day of the primary
11  or election ballots shall be canvassed at the official canvass
12  required for each election as required by section 1403. In all
13  cases where absentee ballots are received after the duplicate
14  list was prepared and distributed to the local election boards
15  in accordance with section 1302.3(b.1) but up until eight
16  o'clock P.M. the day of the primary or election, the county
17  board of elections shall examine the voting check list of the
18  election district of said elector's residence and satisfy itself
19  that such elector did not cast any ballot other than the one
20  properly issued to him under his absentee ballot application. In
21  all cases where such examination discloses that an elector did
22  vote a ballot other than the one properly issued to him under
23  the absentee ballot application, the board of elections shall
24  thereupon cancel said absentee ballot and said elector shall be
25  subject to the penalties as set forth in this act.
26     (b)  Each candidate for nomination or election shall be
27  entitled to appoint one watcher and each political party or body
28  which has nominated candidates shall be entitled to appoint two
29  watchers to be present at each canvass of absentee ballots.
30  Watchers shall be permitted to be present when the envelopes
1  containing official absentee ballots are opened and when such
2  ballots are counted and recorded.
3     (b.1)  In all election districts in which electronic voting
4  systems are used, absentee ballots shall be opened at the
5  election district, checked for write-in votes in accordance with
6  section 1113-A and then either hand-counted or counted by means
7  of the automatic tabulation equipment, whatever the case may be.
8     (d)  Whenever it shall appear by due proof that any absentee
9  elector who has returned his ballot in accordance with the
10  provisions of this act has died prior to the opening of the
11  polls on the day of the primary or election, the ballot of such
12  deceased elector shall be rejected by the canvassers but the
13  counting of the ballot of an elector thus deceased shall not of
14  itself invalidate any nomination or election.
15     (e)  At such time the local election board shall then further
16  examine the declaration on each envelope not so set aside and
17  shall compare the information thereon with that contained in the
18  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and
19  the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters
20  File." If the local election board is satisfied that the
21  declaration is sufficient and the information contained in the
22  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and
23  the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters
24  File" verifies his right to vote, the local election board shall
25  announce the name of the elector and shall give any watcher
26  present an opportunity to challenge any absentee elector upon
27  the ground or grounds (1) that the absentee elector is not a
28  qualified elector; or (2) that the absentee elector was within
29  the municipality of his residence on the day of the primary or
30  election during the period the polls were open, except where he
1  was in military service or except in the case where his ballot
2  was obtained for the reason that he was unable to appear
3  personally at the polling place because of illness or physical
4  disability; or (3) that the absentee elector was able to appear
5  personally at the polling place on the day of the primary or
6  election during the period the polls were open in the case his
7  ballot was obtained for the reason that he was unable to appear
8  personally at the polling place because of illness or physical
9  disability. Upon challenge of any absentee elector, as set forth
10  herein the local election board shall mark "challenged" on the
11  envelope together with the reason or reasons therefor, and the
12  same shall be set aside for return to the county board unopened
13  pending decision by the county board and shall not be counted.
14  All absentee ballots not challenged for any of the reasons
15  provided herein shall be counted and included with the general
16  return of paper ballots or voting machines, as the case may be
17  as follows. Thereupon, the local election board shall open the
18  envelope of every unchallenged absentee elector in such manner
19  as not to destroy the declaration executed thereon. All of such
20  envelopes on which are printed, stamped or endorsed the words
21  "Official Absentee Ballot" shall be placed in one or more
22  depositories at one time and said depository or depositories
23  well shaken and the envelopes mixed before any envelope is taken
24  therefrom. If any of these envelopes shall contain any
25  extraneous marks or identifying symbols other than the words
26  "Official Absentee Ballot," the envelopes and the ballots
27  contained therein shall be set aside and declared void. The
28  local election board shall then break the seals of such
29  envelopes, remove the ballots and record the votes in the same
30  manner as district election officers are required to record
1  votes. With respect to the challenged ballots, they shall be
2  returned to the county board with the returns of the local
3  election district where they shall be placed unopened in a
4  secure, safe and sealed container in the custody of the county
5  board until it shall fix a time and place for a formal hearing
6  of all such challenges and notice shall be given where possible
7  to all absentee electors thus challenged and to every attorney,
8  watcher or candidate who made such challenge. The time for the
9  hearing shall not be later than seven (7) days after the date of
10  said challenge. On the day fixed for said hearing, the county
11  board shall proceed without delay to hear said challenges and,
12  in hearing the testimony, the county board shall not be bound by
13  technical rules of evidence. The testimony presented shall be
14  stenographically recorded and made part of the record of the
15  hearing. The decision of the county board in upholding or
16  dismissing any challenge may be reviewed by the court of common
17  pleas of the county upon a petition filed by any person
18  aggrieved by the decision of the county board. Such appeal shall
19  be taken, within two (2) days after such decision shall have
20  been made, whether reduced to writing or not, to the court of
21  common pleas setting forth the objections to the county board's
22  decision and praying for an order reversing same. Pending the
23  final determination of all appeals, the county board shall
24  suspend any action in canvassing and computing all challenged
25  ballots irrespective of whether or not appeal was taken from the
26  county board's decision. Upon completion of the computation of
27  the returns of the county, the votes cast upon the challenged
28  official absentee ballots shall be added to the other votes cast
29  within the county.
30     (e.1)  Absentee ballots cast by electors qualified in
1  accordance with section 1301(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g)
2  and (h) and received after the canvass required by subsection
3  (a) but by the seventh day following the election which are
4  postmarked no later than the day before the election shall be
5  canvassed in a separate canvass to occur no later than eight (8)
6  days after the election to be conducted in accordance with the
7  procedures required by this section for the first canvass of
8  absentee ballots. Such absentee ballots shall be subject to the
9  challenge procedures specified in subsection (e). The board
10  shall add the results for the second canvass to the totals of
11  the first canvass by election district.
12     (f)  Any person challenging an application for an absentee
13  ballot or an absentee ballot for any of the reasons provided in
14  this act shall deposit the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) in cash
15  with the local election board, in cases of challenges made to
16  the local election board and with the county board in cases of
17  challenges made to the county board for which he shall be issued
18  a receipt for each challenge made, which sum shall only be
19  refunded if the challenge is sustained or if the challenge is
20  withdrawn within [five (5) days] ten (10) days after the primary
21  or election. If the challenge is dismissed by any lawful order
22  then the deposit shall be forfeited. All deposit money received
23  by the local election board shall be turned over to the county
24  board simultaneously with the return of the challenged ballots.
25  The county board shall deposit all deposit money in the general
26  fund of the county.
27     Notice of the requirements of subsection (b) of section 1306
28  shall be printed on the envelope for the absentee ballot.

16  due notice shall have been given as provided by section 1403,
17  publicly commence the computation and canvassing of the returns,
18  and continue the same from day to day until completed, in the
19  manner hereinafter provided. For this purpose any county board
20  may organize itself into sections, each of which may
21  simultaneously proceed with the computation and canvassing of
22  the returns from various districts of the county in the manner
23  provided by this section. The return board shall reconvene at
