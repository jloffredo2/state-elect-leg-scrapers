30  illness, and the name, office address and office telephone
1  number of their attending physician: Provided, however, That in
2  the event any elector entitled to an absentee ballot under this
3  subsection be unable to sign his application because of illness
4  or physical disability, he shall be excused from signing upon
5  making a statement which shall be witnessed by one adult person
6  in substantially the following form: I hereby state that I am

9  or physical disability. I have made or have received assistance
10  in making my mark in lieu of my signature.

14   (Complete Address of Witness)         (Signature of Witness)
15     (e.1)  Any qualified registered elector, including any
16  qualified bedridden or hospitalized veteran, who is unable
17  because of illness or physical disability to attend his polling
18  place on the day of any primary or election or operate a voting
19  machine and state distinctly and audibly that he is unable to do
20  so as required by section 1218 of this act may, with the
21  certification by his attending physician that he is permanently
22  disabled, and physically unable to attend the polls or operate a
23  voting machine and make the distinct and audible statement
24  required by section 1218 appended to the application
25  hereinbefore required, be placed on a permanently disabled
26  absentee ballot list file. An absentee ballot application shall
27  be mailed to every such person for each primary or election so
28  long as he does not lose his voting rights by failure to vote as
29  otherwise required by this act. Such person shall not be
30  required to file a physician's certificate of disability with
1  each application as required in subsection (e) of this section
2  but such person must submit a written statement asserting
3  continuing disability every four years in order to maintain his
4  eligibility to vote under the provisions of this subsection.
5  Should any such person lose his disability he shall inform the
6  county board of elections of the county of his residence.
7     (e.2)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this act any
8  qualified elector who expects to be or is absent from the
9  [Commonwealth or county] municipality of his residence because
10  his duties, occupation or business require him to be elsewhere
11  on the day of any election or a county employe who cannot vote
12  due to duties on election day relating to the conduct of the
13  election or a person who will not attend a polling place because
14  of the observance of a religious holiday may make an application
15  for an absentee ballot by mail by sending a letter to the county
16  board of elections in the county in which his voting residence
17  is located. The letter shall be signed by the applicant and
18  contain his name and place of residence.
19     (f)  The county chairman of each political party or the head
20  of each political body shall designate one representative from
21  his respective political party or body for each public
22  institution. The representatives so appointed shall, at the same
23  time on a date fixed by the county board of election visit every
24  public institution situate in the county for the purpose of
25  obtaining the names and addresses of public institution
26  residents who desire to receive applications for absentee
27  ballots and to act as an election board as provided in
28  subsection (g) of this section. The list of names and addresses
29  thus obtained shall then be submitted by said representatives to
30  the board which shall furnish applications individually to those
1  appearing in the written request. If the chairman or head of a
2  political party or body fails to appoint a representative within
3  fifteen days from written notice from the county board of
4  election, the county board of election shall appoint a
5  representative from the political party or body.
6     (g)  The county board of election shall appoint teams of
7  three members for each public institution that shall go to the
8  public institutions and hold the election on the first Friday
9  prior to election day. Each member of the board shall appoint
10  one member on every team. After the votes are cast, the teams
11  shall collect the ballots and return them to the county board of
12  election where they shall be placed unopened in a secure, safe
13  and sealed container in the custody of the board until they
14  shall be distributed to the respective absentee voters' election
15  district as provided in section 1308 of this act where they
16  shall be counted with the other absentee ballots, if any.
17     (h)  The county board of election shall number, in
18  chronological order, the applications for an official absentee
19  ballot, which number shall likewise appear on the official
20  absentee ballot for the qualified elector. The numbers shall
21  appear legibly and in a conspicuous place but before the ballots
22  are distributed the number on the ballot shall be torn off by
23  the county board of election. This number information shall be
24  appropriately inserted and become a part of the Registered
25  Absentee Voters File and the Military, Veterans and Emergency
26  Civilian Absentee Voters File provided in section 1302.3 of this
27  act.
28     (i)  Application for official absentee ballots shall be on
29  forms prescribed by the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The
30  application shall state that a voter who receives an absentee
1  ballot pursuant to section 1301 and who, on election day, is
2  capable of voting at the appropriate polling place must void the
3  absentee ballot and vote in the normal manner at the appropriate
4  voting place. Such forms shall be made freely available to the
5  public at county board of elections, municipal buildings and at
6  such other locations designated by the secretary. No written
7  application or personal request shall be necessary to receive
8  the application forms. Copies of all completed applications for
9  official absentee ballots shall be retained by the county board
10  of elections.
11     Section 16.  Sections 1302.1, 1306 and 1308(e) of the act,
12  amended December 11, 1968 (P.L.1183, No.375), are amended to

30  black or blue-black ink, in fountain pen or ball point pen, and
1  then fold the ballot, enclose and securely seal the same in the
2  envelope on which is printed, stamped or endorsed "Official

4  second one, on which is printed the form of declaration of the

10  except where franked, or deliver it in person to said county
11  board of election:
12     Provided, however, That any elector, spouse of the elector or

9     (b) In the event that any such elector, excepting an elector
10  in military service or any elector unable to go to his polling
11  place because of illness or physical disability, entitled to
12  vote an official absentee ballot shall be in the [county]
13  municipality of his residence on the day for holding the primary
14  or election for which the ballot was issued, or in the event any
15  such elector shall have recovered from his illness or physical
16  disability sufficiently to permit him to present himself at the
17  proper polling place for the purpose of casting his ballot, such
18  absentee ballot cast by such elector shall, be declared void.
19     Any such elector referred to in this subsection, who is
20  within the [county] municipality of his residence must present
21  himself at his polling place and, shall be permitted to vote
22  upon presenting himself at his regular polling place in the same
23  manner as he could have voted had he not received an absentee

25  to the judge of elections in his local election district and
26  shall have signed the affidavit on the absentee voter's
27  temporary registration card, which affidavit shall be in
28  substantially the following form:
29     I hereby swear that I am a qualified registered elector who
30  has obtained an absentee ballot, however, I am present in the
1  [county] municipality of my residence and physically able to
2  present myself at my polling place and therefore request that my
3  absentee ballot be voided.

7       (Local Judge of Elections)
8     An elector who has received an absentee ballot under the
9  emergency application provisions of section 1302.1, and for
10  whom, therefore, no temporary absentee voter's registration card
11  is in the district register, shall sign the aforementioned
12  affidavit in any case, which the local judge of elections shall
13  then cause to be inserted in the district register with the
14  elector's permanent registration card.
15     Section 1308.  Canvassing of Official Absentee Ballots.--
16     * * *
17     (e)  At such time the local election board shall then further
18  examine the declaration on each envelope not so set aside and
19  shall compare the information thereon with that contained in the
20  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and
21  the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters
22  File." If the local election board is satisfied that the
23  declaration is sufficient and the information contained in the
24  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and
25  the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters
26  File" verifies his right to vote, the local election board shall
27  announce the name of the elector and shall give any watcher
28  present an opportunity to challenge any absentee elector upon
29  the ground or grounds (1) that the absentee elector is not a
30  qualified elector; or (2) that the absentee elector was within
1  the [county] municipality of his residence on the day of the
2  primary or election during the period the polls were open,
3  except where he was in military service or except in the case
4  where his ballot was obtained for the reason that he was unable
5  to appear personally at the polling place because of illness or
6  physical disability; or (3) that the absentee elector was able
7  to appear personally at the polling place on the day of the
8  primary or election during the period the polls were open in the
9  case his ballot was obtained for the reason that he was unable
10  to appear personally at the polling place because of illness or
11  physical disability. Upon challenge of any absentee elector, as
12  set forth herein the local election board shall mark
13  "challenged" on the envelope together with the reason or reasons
14  therefor, and the same shall be set aside for return to the
15  county board unopened pending decision by the county board and
16  shall not be counted. All absentee ballots not challenged for
17  any of the reasons provided herein shall be counted and included
18  with the general return of paper ballots or voting machines, as
19  the case may be as follows. Thereupon, the local election board
20  shall open the envelope of every unchallenged absentee elector
21  in such manner as not to destroy the declaration executed
22  thereon. All of such envelopes on which are printed, stamped or
23  endorsed the words "Official Absentee Ballot" shall be placed in
24  one or more depositories at one time and said depository or
25  depositories well shaken and the envelopes mixed before any
26  envelope is taken therefrom. If any of these envelopes shall
27  contain any extraneous marks or identifying symbols other than
28  the words "Official Absentee Ballot," the envelopes and the
29  ballots contained therein shall be set aside and declared void.
30  The local election board shall then break the seals of such
1  envelopes, remove the ballots and record the votes in the same
2  manner as district election officers are required to record
3  votes. With respect to the challenged ballots, they shall be
4  returned to the county board with the returns of the local
5  election district where they shall be placed unopened in a
6  secure, safe and sealed container in the custody of the county
7  board until it shall fix a time and place for a formal hearing
8  of all such challenges and notice shall be given where possible
9  to all absentee electors thus challenged and to every attorney,
10  watcher or candidate who made such challenge. The time for the
11  hearing shall not be later than seven (7) days after the date of
12  said challenge. On the day fixed for said hearing, the county
13  board shall proceed without delay to hear said challenges and,
14  in hearing the testimony, the county board shall not be bound by
15  technical rules of evidence. The testimony presented shall be
16  stenographically recorded and made part of the record of the
17  hearing. The decision of the county board in upholding or
18  dismissing any challenge may be reviewed by the court of common
19  pleas of the county upon a petition filed by any person
20  aggrieved by the decision of the county board. Such appeal shall
21  be taken, within two (2) days after such decision shall have
22  been made, whether reduced to writing or not, to the court of
23  common pleas setting forth the objections to the county board's
24  decision and praying for an order reversing same. Pending the
25  final determination of all appeals, the county board shall
26  suspend any action in canvassing and computing all challenged
27  ballots irrespective of whether or not appeal was taken from the
28  county board's decision. Upon completion of the computation of
29  the returns of the county, the votes cast upon the challenged
30  official absentee ballots shall be added to the other votes cast
1  within the county.
