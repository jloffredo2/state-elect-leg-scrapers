16  (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code,
17  amended December 11, 1968 (P.L.1183, No.375), is amended and the
18  section is amended by adding a subsection to read:
19     Section 1308.  Canvassing of Official Absentee Ballots.--
20     (a)  The county boards of election, upon receipt of official
21  absentee ballots in such envelopes, shall safely keep the same
22  in sealed or locked containers until they distribute same to the
1  appropriate local election districts in a manner prescribed by
2  the Secretary of the Commonwealth.
3     The county board of elections shall then distribute the
4  absentee ballots, unopened, to the absentee voter's respective
5  election district concurrently with the distribution of the
6  other election supplies. Absentee ballots shall be canvassed
7  immediately and continuously without interruption until
8  completed after the close of the polls on the day of the
9  election in each election district. The results of the canvass
10  of the absentee ballots shall then be included in and returned
11  to the county board with the returns of that district. [No]
12  Except as provided in subsection (g), no absentee ballot shall
13  be counted which is received in the office of the county board
14  of election later than five o'clock P. M. on the Friday
15  immediately preceding the primary or November election.
16     * * *
17     (g)  (1)  An absentee ballot cast by any absentee elector as
18  defined in section 1301(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f), who is    <--
19  outside of the territorial limits of the several states of the
20  United States and the District of Columbia, which is received in
21  the office of the county board of elections after five o'clock
22  P. M. on the Friday immediately preceding the election and no
23  later than five o'clock P. M. on the seventh day following an
24  election shall be canvassed in accordance with this subsection
25  if the absentee ballot is postmarked no later than the day
26  immediately preceding the election.
27     (2)  The county board of elections shall meet on the eighth
28  day following the election to canvass the absentee ballots
29  received under this subsection. One authorized representative of
30  each candidate in an election and one representative from each
1  political party shall be permitted to remain in the room in
2  which the absentee ballots are canvassed. Representatives shall
3  be permitted to challenge any absentee elector in accordance
4  with the provisions of paragraph (3).
5     (3)  When the county board meets to canvass absentee ballots
6  under paragraph (2) the board shall examine the declaration on
7  the envelope of each ballot not set aside under subsection (d)
8  and shall compare the information thereon with that contained in
9  the "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list
10  and/or the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee
11  Voters File," whichever is applicable. If the county board is
12  satisfied that the declaration is sufficient and the information
13  contained in the "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee
14  voters' list and/or the "Military Veterans and Emergency
15  Civilians Absentee Voters File" verifies his right to vote, the
16  county board shall announce the name of the elector and shall
17  give any candidate representative or party representative
18  present an opportunity to challenge any absentee elector upon
19  the ground or grounds (i) that the absentee elector is not a
20  qualified elector; or (ii) that the absentee elector was within
21  the municipality of his residence on the day of the primary or
22  election during the period the polls were open, except where he
23  was in the military service or except in the case where his
24  ballot was obtained for the reason that he was unable to appear
25  personally at the polling place because of illness or physical
26  disability; or (iii) that the absentee elector was able to
27  appear personally at the polling place on the day of the primary
28  or election during the period the polls were open in the case
29  his ballot was obtained for the reason that he was unable to
30  appear personally at the polling place because of illness or
1  physical disability. Upon challenge of any absentee elector, as
2  set forth herein, the board shall mark "challenged" on the
3  envelope together with the reasons therefor, and the same shall
4  be set aside unopened pending final determination of the
5  challenge according to the procedure described in paragraph (5).
6     (4)  All absentee ballots not challenged for any of the
7  reasons provided in paragraph (3) shall be counted and included
8  with the returns of the applicable election district, as
9  follows. The county board shall open the envelope of every
10  unchallenged absentee elector in such manner as not to destroy
11  the declaration executed thereon. If any of the envelopes on
12  which are printed, stamped or endorsed the words "Official
13  Absentee Ballot" contain any extraneous marks or identifying
14  symbols the envelopes and the ballots contained therein shall be
15  set aside and declared void. The county board shall then break
16  the seals of such envelopes, remove the ballots and record the
17  votes.
18     (5)  With respect to the challenged ballots, they shall be
19  placed unopened in a secure, safe and sealed container in the
20  custody of the county board until it shall fix a time and place
21  for a formal hearing of all such challenges and notice shall be
22  given where possible to all absentee electors thus challenged
23  and to every individual who made a challenge. The time for the
24  hearing shall not be later than five (5) days after the date of
25  the challenge. On the day fixed for said hearing, the county
26  board shall proceed without delay to hear said challenges and,
27  in hearing the testimony, the county board shall not be bound by
28  the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence. The testimony presented
29  shall be stenographically recorded and made part of the record
30  of the hearing.
1     (6)  The decision of the county board in upholding or
2  dismissing any challenge may be reviewed by the court of common
3  pleas of the county upon a petition filed by any person
4  aggrieved by the decision of the county board. The appeal shall
5  be taken, within two (2) days after the decision was made,
6  whether the decision was reduced to writing or not, to the court
7  of common pleas setting forth the objections to the county
8  board's decision and praying for an order reversing the
9  decision.
10     (7)  Pending the final determination of all appeals, the
11  county board shall suspend any action in canvassing and
12  computing all challenged ballots received under this subsection
13  irrespective of whether or not appeal was taken from the county
14  board's decision. Upon completion of the computation of the
15  returns of the county, the votes cast upon the challenged
16  official absentee ballots that have been finally determined to
17  be valid shall be added to the other votes cast within the
18  county.
19     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
