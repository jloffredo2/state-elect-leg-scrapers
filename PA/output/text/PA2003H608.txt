29  shall have recovered from his illness or physical disability
30  sufficiently to permit him to present himself at the proper
1  polling place for the purpose of casting his ballot, such
2  absentee ballot cast by such elector shall, be declared void.
3     Any such elector referred to in this subsection, who is
4  within the municipality of his residence, must present himself

11  temporary registration card, which affidavit shall be in
12  substantially the following form:
13     I hereby swear that I am a qualified registered elector who
14  has obtained an absentee ballot, however, I am present in the
15  municipality of my residence and physically able to present
16  myself at my polling place and therefore request that my
17  absentee ballot be voided.

25  is in the district register, shall sign the aforementioned
26  affidavit in any case, which the local judge of elections shall
27  then cause to be inserted in the district register with the
28  elector's permanent registration card.
