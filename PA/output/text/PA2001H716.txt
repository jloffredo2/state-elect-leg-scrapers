8     Section 1.  Section 905 of the act of June 30, 1995 (P.L.170,
9  No.25), known as the Pennsylvania Voter Registration Act, is
10  amended to read:
11  Section 905.  Department of Health.
12     The registration commission shall immediately cancel the
13  registration of a registered elector reported dead by the
14  Department of Health. The Department of Health shall[, within 60
1  days of receiving notice of the death of an individual 18 years
2  of age or older, send the] report to the registration commission
3  within 30 days of the last day of each calendar month the deaths
4  of residents of such counties, except residents under 18 years
5  of age, for that month. Such report shall include the full name
6  and last address of residence of that individual [to the
7  commission], the date of his birth, if available, and the date
8  of death on a form prescribed by the department. The
9  registration commission shall, on the last day of each calendar
10  month, report to the Bureau of Commissions, Elections and
11  Legislation in the Department of State the registration
12  cancellations made pursuant to the reports of the Department of
13  Health for the previous month. An individual incorrectly
14  reported deceased by the Department of Health may appear in
15  person before a commissioner, registrar or clerk at the office
16  of the commission and prove identity. The commission, upon such
17  proof, shall correct its records. In the event the Bureau of
18  Commissions, Elections and Legislation determines that the
19  registration commission of any county has failed to timely
20  cancel the registration of any person reported to it as deceased
21  by the Department of Health, such failure shall constitute
22  nonfeasance in office and upon notification to the registration
23  commission each commissioner shall be deemed as removed from
24  office immediately. The president judge of the court of common
25  pleas shall fill each vacancy by appointing a judge or an
26  elector of the county to serve as an interim registration
27  commissioner for the remainder of the term.
28     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
