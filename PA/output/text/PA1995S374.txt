14  reside at the same address UNLESS THE REGISTERED ELECTOR'S        <--
15  REGISTRATION IS CANCELED BY REASON OF FAILURE TO VOTE FOR THE

12     of abode.
13         (4)  If an individual removes to another state with the
14     intention of making that state the permanent residence, the
15     individual shall be considered to have lost residence in this
16     Commonwealth.
17         (5)  If an individual removes to another state with the
18     intention of remaining there an indefinite time and making
19     that state the place of residence, the individual shall be
20     considered to have lost residence in this Commonwealth,
21     notwithstanding an intention to return at some indefinite
22     future period.
23         (6)  If an individual goes into another state and, while
24     there, votes in an election held by that state, the
25     individual shall be considered to have lost residence in this
26     Commonwealth.
27         (7)  An individual employed in the service of the Federal
28     Government or of the Commonwealth and required thereby to be
29     absent from the municipality where the individual resided
30     when entering that employment, and the spouse of the
1     individual, may remain registered as of the district where

11         of the Commonwealth and setting forth the nature of the
12         employment and the time when the employee first entered
13         the employment. The commission shall retain certificates
14         under this subparagraph.
15             (ii)  The commission shall note on the registration
16         card of each individual registered under this paragraph
17         the fact of Federal or State employment.
18             (iii)  At least once every two years the commission
19         shall verify the employment of the individuals registered
20         under this paragraph at the proper Federal or State
21         office. If an individual is found to be no longer a
22         Federal or State employee, the individual's registration
23         shall be canceled under Chapter 9.

22     not left that home address but continued to reside there.
23         (3)  The commission is authorized to consider a request
24     for an absentee ballot as a request for an official

29         (3)  Boxes for the applicant to check to indicate whether
30     the applicant would like to register or decline to register
1     to vote. In close proximity to the boxes the following words
2     shall appear in prominent type: "IF YOU DO NOT CHECK EITHER

29     discourage the applicant from registering to vote.
30         (3)  They shall not make any statement to an applicant or
1     take any action the purpose or effect of which is to lead the

1     registration applications which are not postage paid and may
2     also print and distribute mail registration applications.
3     Such applications shall not be specific to any county
4     registration office. Along with the distribution of such
5     applications, the secretary shall also include instructions
6     to inform the applicant where the application is to be sent.
7     Such an application shall contain a notice that a postage-
8     paid application is available from the commission.

23  Section 528.  Approval of registration applications.
24     (a)  Examination.--
25         (1)  Official registration applications submitted to a
26     registration commission shall be examined by the commissioner
27     or a clerk or registrar upon receipt.
28         (2)  If the official voter registration application
29     submission is in person, the application shall be attested
30     and dated by the commissioner, clerk or registrar.
1         (3)  Upon receipt of any other voter registration
2     application, the commission shall make an entry of the date
3     received on the application. If the applicant does not reside
4     within the commission's county but resides elsewhere in this
5     Commonwealth, the commission shall forward the application
6     card to the proper commission and make a record of the
7     forwarding.
8     (b)  Decision.--
9         (1)  If the commission finds the official registration
10     application not properly completed, the application shall be
11     rejected. The commission shall make reasonable efforts to
12     complete the registration before rejecting it for omissions
13     and inconsistencies. If the commission rejects an application
14     under this paragraph, it shall indicate "REJECTED" on the
15     application and state there the reason for rejection and
16     notify the applicant by first class nonforwardable mail,
17     return postage guaranteed.
18         (2)  If the official registration application contains
19     the required information indicating that the applicant is
20     legally qualified to register as stated in the application,
21     the commission shall mail to the applicant a voter's
22     identification card in accordance with subsection (d)(1).
23         (3)  For an application for a transfer of registration or
24     a change in address or name, if the application contains the
25     required information and the applicant is legally qualified
26     to transfer registration or change name or address as stated
27     in the application, the commission shall make the transfer or
28     change. If the commission suspects that the applicant is not
29     entitled to transfer registration or to change name or
30     address, the commission may investigate. If the commission
1     finds that the applicant is not entitled to the transfer or
2     change, the application shall be rejected. The applicant
3     shall be notified of the rejection and the reason for it.
4     Rejection must be made no later than ten days before the
5     election succeeding the filing of the application.
6     (c)  Result.--If an application is designed to serve as a
7  registration card, the accepted application of an elector may
8  serve as the elector's official registration card if it was so
9  designed and shall be filed in the office of the commission in
10  accordance with Chapter 7. If the application is not designed to
11  serve as a registration card, the information contained on the
12  application, including the elector's signature, shall be
13  transferred to the registration card. If a commission utilizes a
14  signature digitization list, it shall transfer all information
15  contained on the application, including the signature, to a
16  computer file. The right of an individual to be registered shall
17  not be subject to challenge for any reason other than failure to
18  have furnished the commission a properly completed registration
19  application. Applicants for registration shall be challenged
20  under section 529.
21     (d)  Disposition.--
22         (1)  When the registration of an elector has been finally
23     processed under subsection (b)(2), the commission shall
24     transmit to the applicant by first-class nonforwardable mail
25     a wallet-sized voter's identification card, which shall serve
26     as notice to the applicant of the disposition of the
27     application. The card shall contain all of the following:
28             (i)  Name and address of the elector.
29             (ii)  Name of municipality.
30             (iii)  Identification of elector's ward and district.
1             (iv)  Effective date of registration.
2             (v)  Designation of party enrollment and date of
3         enrollment.
4             (vi)  A space for the elector's signature or mark.
5             (vii)  A statement that the card relates only to the
6         time of issuance of the card and is not of itself
7         evidence or proof of the qualifications of the elector to
8         vote at an election and that it is not necessary to
9         present the card when voting. The statements required by
10         this subparagraph shall be placed on the reverse side of
11         the card from where all of the other information required
12         by this paragraph is placed.
13         (2)  The carrier envelope in which the identification
14     card is enclosed shall contain on the outside a request to
15     the postmaster to return it within five days if it cannot be
16     delivered to the addressee at the address given.
17         (3)  No registration application shall be deemed to be
18     accepted until ten days after the voter's identification card
19     has been mailed. Upon return by the post office of an
20     identification card under paragraph (2) which the post office
21     is unable to deliver at the given address, the commission
22     shall investigate. If the commission finds that the applicant
23     is not qualified to register from such address, the
24     commission shall reject the application of the applicant and
25     shall notify the applicant by first class forwardable mail of
26     this action.
27         (4)  If the applicant discloses that the elector's last
28     residence address upon registration was a location within
29     another county, the commission shall direct a cancellation
30     notice to the commission of that county. This cancellation
1     notice shall be in a form approved by the secretary in
2     substantially the following form:
3         Date .........................
4               Office of the Registration Commission

11  has been denied may file with the commission a petition to be

27                              RECORDS
28  Section 701.  General register.
29     (a)  Original registration cards.--If a commission uses the
30  original registration cards for registered electors in the
1  county as the district register, the duplicate registration
2  cards or photocopies of the original registration cards shall be
3  placed in exact alphabetical order by last name of the
4  registrant, shall be indexed and shall be kept at the office of
5  the registration commission in a manner as to be properly
6  safeguarded. These cards constitute the general register of the
7  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
8  commission except upon order of a court of record. Nothing in
9  this act shall preclude the use of duplicate registration cards
10  from applications provided under the act of March 30, 1937
11  (P.L.115, No.40), known as The First Class City Permanent
12  Registration Act, or the act of April 29, 1937 (P.L.487,
13  No.115), known as The Permanent Registration Act for Cities of
14  the Second Class, Cities of the Second Class A, Cities of the
15  Third Class, Boroughs, Towns, and Townships.
16     (b)  Digitized signature lists.-- If a commission uses
17  digitized signature lists as the district register, the original
18  registration cards shall be placed in exact alphabetical order
19  by last name of the registrant, indexed and kept at the office
20  of the commission in a manner as to be properly safeguarded.
21  These original cards constitute the general register of the
22  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
23  commission except upon order of a court of record. The
24  commission shall safely retain all registration cards used in
25  the registration of electors or in conducting an election. If a
26  commission has the capability to accept an electronic
27  application, the secretary may require the commission to produce
28  a computer-generated card to file in the general register. If
29  the commission finds a record for a registrant on the computer
30  data base which is not contained in the general register, it
1  shall replace the original card with a computer-generated
2  duplicate card upon written permission from the registrant or
3  upon order of a court of record.
4     (c)  Duplicate files.--If the commission deems a duplicate
5  file of registration cards necessary for administrative
6  purposes, the commission may prepare a reproduction in
7  compliance with the following:
8         (1)  The registration form shall be photographed,
9     microphotographed or reproduced in a manner approved for
10     permanent records by the secretary.
11         (2)  The device used to reproduce the card shall be one
12     which accurately reproduces the original in all details.
13         (3)  The photographs, microphotographs or other
14     reproductions shall be open to public inspection and
15     provision is made for preserving, examining and using them.
16  Section 702.  District registers.
17     (a)  Registration card file.--
18         (1)  Except as provided in subsection (b) and in section
19     701(b), the original registration cards shall be filed by
20     election districts in exact alphabetical order by last name
21     of the registrant and shall be indexed.
22         (2)  The cards constitute the district register.
23         (3)  The commission shall provide binders, which are
24     capable of being locked, for filing and indexing the
25     registration cards. The keys to the binders shall at all
26     times be retained by the commission.
27         (4)  The district register shall be kept at the office of
28     the commission except as provided in subsection (b) and shall
29     be open to public inspection, subject to reasonable
30     safeguards and regulations.
1     (b)  Computer lists.--
2         (1)  Instead of using registration cards as the district
3  register as provided in subsection (a), a commission may, at its
4  option and at county expense, use a computer list or computer-
5  generated cards containing the registered electors arranged by
6  election district, alphabetically by last name of the
7  registrant.
8         (2)  The computer list or computer-generated cards shall
9     be in a form prescribed by the secretary and shall contain
10     necessary information that would otherwise be available on
11     the registration cards, including a legible digitized
12     signature of the registrant copied from the signature on the
13     registration card. The district election officials shall have
14     computer printouts at the polling places containing the
15     necessary information needed to verify the identity of the
16     elector. The digitized signature list shall be open to public
17     inspection, subject to reasonable safeguards and regulations.
18         (3)  A commission may, during systems conversion periods
19     or emergency conditions, provide for a district register
20     containing the original registration cards. The following
21     apply:
22             (i)  The original registration cards shall be filed
23         by election district in one of the following orders as
24         determined by the commission:
25                 (A)  Exact alphabetical order by last name of
26             registrant.
27                 (B)  Order in which registrants' residences
28             appear upon the streets of the election district, in
29             exact alphabetical order by last name of registrant
30             for each residence.
1             (ii)  The district register containing registration
2         cards shall be kept at the office of the commission and
3         shall be open for public inspection, subject to
4         reasonable safeguards and regulations and to the
5         provisions of this act.
6     (c)  Currency.--It is the duty of the commission to compare
7  and correct the general register and district registers to
8  ensure their accuracy. By noon of the third day preceding an
9  election, the commission shall have the district register for
10  each election district accurately corrected to date.
11     (d)  Delivery.--The commission shall deliver, in the manner
12  required by law for delivery of election materials, the district
13  register to the election officers for use on election day.
14     (e)  Form.--District registers shall be enclosed within a
15  case or container and shall be locked and sealed by the
16  commission before delivery. The district register shall have
17  printed or written thereon the words "District Register of
18  Voters" and the district and ward, if any.
19     (f)  Examination.--Immediately following each election, the
20  commission shall cause each district register to be examined.
21  The commission specifically shall compare the signature of each
22  elector on each voter's certificate with the elector's signature
23  in the district register and shall report in writing to the
24  district attorney any evidence or indication of probable fraud,
25  impersonation or forgery which may appear to the commission by
26  reason of the comparison. In the case of any elector whom the
27  election officers have recorded as removed, deceased or
28  challenged and have prevented from voting, the commission shall
29  ascertain the facts and shall correct the general and district
30  registers in accordance with Chapter 9.

2     (a)  Preparation.--Commencing not later than the 15th day

6  The list may not include the digitized signature of a registered
7  voter. The list shall be arranged in one of the following
8  manners:
9         (1)  By streets and house numbers.
10         (2)  Alphabetically by last name of registrant.
11         (3)  In a manner whereby the location of the elector's
12     residence can be identified.
13     (b)  Retention.--The commission shall retain two copies of
14  the list under subsection (a) on file at its office. These
15  copies shall be available for public inspection during business
16  hours, subject to reasonable safeguards and regulations.

18     contained in the list for purposes unrelated to elections,
19     political activities or law enforcement. Before inspecting
20     the list or obtaining names of voters or other information
21     from the list, the individual must provide identification to
22     the public official having custody of the public information
23     list and must state in writing that any information obtained

28     activities or in response to a law enforcement inquiry from a
29     public official concerning a failure to comply with any

2     lists must be made and processed in the manner provided in
3     the regulations of the secretary. Upon receipt of a copy of
4     the court order, the secretary shall withhold from the public

30     registration agency through which any particular voter is
1     registered.

7     notice and returning it to the office of the commission,
8     secure the transfer of registration, effective as to
9     elections at least 30 days after the date of removal into the
10     new district.
11         (4)  The notice shall contain a warning to the elector
12     that the notice will not be accepted as an application for
13     transfer of the elector's registration unless the signature
14     thereon can be identified by the commission as the elector's
15     signature as it appears on file with the commission.

22     (b)  Use.--An elector who removes residence from one place to

4         (2)  An elector who removes residence from one place to
5     another within the same county and who has not yet filed a
6     removal notice with the commission shall be permitted to vote
7     at the election next following removal if, at the time of
8     signing voter's certificate, the elector files with the judge
9     of election a signed removal notice properly filled out.
10     Removal notices under this paragraph shall be returned to the
11     commission with the voting check list, and the commission
12     shall proceed to transfer the registration of the electors
13     under section 902.

16  removal under section 901(b), the registration commission shall
17  proceed as follows:
18         (1)  The signature on the notification document shall be
19     compared with the signature of the elector as it appears on
20     file with the commission.
21         (2)  If the signature appears authentic, the commission
22     shall enter the change of residence on the registration card
23     of the elector in the general register and district register
24     and shall transfer the registration card of the elector from
25     the district register of the election district of previous
26     residence to the district register of the election district
27     of new residence.
28         (3)  If a request for transfer which is determined to be
29     authentic under paragraph (2) shows a removal within the
30     period of 30 days preceding an election, the commission,
1     after such election, shall enter the change of residence on
2     the registration card of the elector in the general register
3     and district register and shall transfer the registration
4     card of the elector from the district register of the
5     election district of previous residence. The commission shall
6     advise the elector promptly in writing of its action.
7     (b)  Electors unable to write.--An elector who is unable to
8  sign the notification document may affix a mark to the

16  clerk, or may submit an application by mail under section 524,
17  and state in a signed writing the political party in which the
18  voter desires to be enrolled. If the signature of the elector is
19  verified by comparison with the elector's signature as it
20  appears on file with the commission, the commissioner, registrar
21  or clerk shall make the change in the general register and
22  district register. If supported by other evidence of identity, a
23  mark may be made in lieu of a signature by an elector who is
24  unable to write. The mark must be made in the presence of a
25  witness, who must sign the registration application.

10     1218 of the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as
11     the Pennsylvania Election Code.
12     (b)  Termination.--If the commission ascertains that an
13  elector who has declared need for assistance is no longer in
14  need of assistance, it shall cancel on the registration card the
15  entry relating to illiteracy or physical disability which
16  authorized assistance. The commission shall notify the elector
17  by mail of its action.

28  proof, shall correct its records.

7  person who contracted for service and the addresses to which
8  that person has removed.
9     (b)  Real estate brokers and rental agents.--Subject to the
10  provisions of this act, real estate brokers and rental agents

12  the commission, all cases of residence property managed by them
13  which have been vacated by the tenant. The report shall include,

16  Section 907.  Checkup of registers.
17     (a)  General rule.--At any time prior to the 30th day
18  preceding an election, the commission may mail to any qualified
19  elector whose name appears in any district register a notice
20  setting forth the elector's name and address as it appears in
21  the register, requesting the elector in case of any error to
22  present the notice within ten days at the office of the
23  commission to have the error corrected and warning that any
24  discrepancy between the qualified elector's actual name and
25  address and the name and address as recorded in the original
26  register will constitute ground for challenging the elector's
27  vote. The notice shall contain on the outside, "Do not forward,
28  return to Board of Elections," and a request of the Postal
29  Service to return it within five days if it cannot be delivered
30  to the addressee at the address given.
1     (b)  Checkup by Postal Service.--At any time prior to the

6  the commission may conduct a checkup of each registered elector
7  by either of the methods provided for in subsections (a) and

9     (d)  Failure to deliver notice.--Upon the return by the
10  Postal Service of any notice which it has been unable to deliver
11  at the given address because the addressee cannot be found there
12  or upon report by the Postal Service that any registered elector
13  does not reside at the address given on the registration card,
14  the commission shall do one of the following:
15         (1)  Direct an authorized employee to visit in person the
16     address of the qualified elector and, if the employee finds
17     that the qualified elector does not reside at the address, to
18     leave at the address the notice prescribed by subsection (e).
19         (2)  Mail to the registered qualified elector at the
20  address given on the registration card the notice prescribed by
21  subsection (e). The notice shall be sent as first-class mail and
22  shall contain on the outside a request to the postmaster to
23  forward it if the addressee does not reside at the address given
24  thereon.
25     (e)  Communication with commission.--The notice stipulated by
26  subsection (d) shall require the registered qualified elector to
27  communicate with the commission by a date designated by the
28  commission, which (date) shall be not less than ten days nor
29  more than 30 days from the service or mailing of the notice and,
30  in any case, not later than the 15th day preceding the election,

2  elector. At the expiration of the time specified in the notice,
3  the commission shall cancel the registration of a person who has

5  as a qualified elector; however, if a registered qualified
6  elector who has been mailed the notice prescribed by this
7  subsection communicates with the commission claiming the right
8  to remain registered at the address to which the original notice
9  was mailed, the commission shall investigate and, if not
10  satisfied of the right of the qualified elector to remain
11  registered at the address, shall cancel the registration of the
12  elector. Every elector whose registration is canceled under this
13  section must register in the manner provided by this act in
14  order to be eligible to vote at any election.
15     (f)  Elector in military service.--The registration of a
16  person in military service shall not be canceled by reason of

18  upon the district register if the person resided at the address
19  on the date of entering military service.
20  Section 908.  Canvass of registered electors.
21     (a)  Verification.--The commission may, by individual

25  commission deems necessary. The commission shall make a record
26  of the name and address of each person registered who is not
27  found to reside at the address from which the person is
28  registered or who, for any other reason, appears to be not

9  number of election districts which the commission determines to
10  canvass. They must be qualified electors of the county. They

25         (1)  Sufficient grounds for the cancellation or
26     suspension.

28             (i)  notice of the time and place when the petition
29         would be presented has been given personally to the
30         registered qualified elector at least 24 hours prior to
1         the presentation of the petition; or
2             (ii)  the registered qualified elector could not be
3         found at the place given in the district register as
4         residence and the person in charge of that place, whose
5         name must be given in the petition, has declared that the
6         person was well acquainted with the names of all
7         individuals residing at the place and that the registered
8         qualified elector had never been or was no longer one of
9         them or that no such individual is residing at the
10         address.
11     (b)  Action.--Upon receipt of a petition under subsection
12  (a), the commission shall cancel or suspend the registration of
13  the qualified elector and amend accordingly the general and
14  district registers and other records affected unless the
15  qualified elector so registered appears and shows cause why this
16  action should not take place.
17  Section 911.  Failure to vote.
18     (a)  Check of electors.--By April 1 of each year except in a
19  year in which the commission conducts a check of electors under
20  section 907(c), the commission shall examine all of the district
21  registers.
22     (b)  Suspension.--A qualified elector who has been registered
23  for a period of at least two immediately preceding calendar
24  years but who is not recorded as having voted at an election
25  during that period is subject to suspension of registration in
26  accordance with the following procedure:
27         (1)  If a qualified elector who has been registered for a
28     period of at least two immediately preceding calendar years
29     is not recorded as having voted at an election during that
30     period, the commission shall send to the qualified elector by
1     mail, at the address appearing upon the registration card, a
2     notice setting forth that the records of the commission
3     indicate that the qualified elector has not voted during the
4     two immediately preceding calendar years and that the
5     qualified elector's registration will be canceled at the
6     expiration of 30 days from the date of mailing the notice
7     unless the qualified elector, within that period, files with
8     the commission, either personally or by mail, a written
9     request for reinstatement of registration or a removal notice
10     properly executed, setting forth the qualified elector's
11     place of residence and signed by the qualified elector.
12         (2)  Within 30 days from the date of mailing of the

16     executed removal notice, which sets forth the qualified
17     elector's place of residence and which is signed by the
18     qualified elector. The official registration application card
19     of a qualified elector who has registered by mail qualifies
20     as a request for reinstatement of registration or a removal
21     notice under this paragraph.
22         (3)  Within 30 days from the date of mailing of the
23     notice under paragraph (1), the commission shall cancel the
24     registration of a qualified elector who has not complied with
25     paragraph (2).
26     (c)  Effect.--Cancellation of registration under this section
27  shall not affect the right of a qualified elector to
28  subsequently register in the manner provided by this act.

30                 registration cards.

2  elector is canceled for any cause, the commission shall mark on
3  the registration cards of the elector the word "canceled" and

6  for five years. After five years, the commission may destroy it.
7     (b)  Nonessential records.--All records which are not
8  essential for maintaining the current status of a qualified
9  elector may be destroyed by the commission after three years.
10  Section 13.  Correction of errors in cancellation or suspension.
11     If the registration of a qualified elector has been canceled
12  or suspended through error, the qualified elector may petition
13  the commission for reinstatement of registration not later than
14  the tenth day preceding an election. After a hearing on the
15  application, if error on the part of the commission is proved,
16  the commission shall reinstate the registration.
