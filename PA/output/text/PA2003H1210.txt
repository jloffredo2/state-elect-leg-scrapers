19                     ELECTION DAY REGISTRATION
20  Section 301.  Election day registration.
21     (a)  General rule.--An individual otherwise eligible to vote
22  may register to vote on the day of any primary, municipal or
23  general election by appearing in person at the polling place for
24  the election district in which the individual maintains
25  residence, completing a registration card, making an oath in the
26  form prescribed by the department and providing proof of
27  residence.
28     (b)  Proof of residence.--An individual may prove residence
29  by any of the following methods:
30         (1)  By displaying a valid driver's license.
1         (2)  By showing any document approved by the department.
2         (3)  By the written statement of an elector registered to
3     vote in that election district, sworn to in the presence of a
4     judge of elections, stating to the effect that the elector
5     personally knows that the individual is a resident of the
6     election district. An individual who proves residence under
7     this paragraph on election day may not sign a proof of
8     residence oath vouching for any other individual on that
9     election day.
10  Section 302.  Procedure.
11     (a)  Judges of elections.--Voter registration under this act
12  shall be conducted by judges of elections. A judge who registers
13  an individual voter may not process that voter's ballot at any
14  time prior to opening of the ballot box after the voting ends.
15     (b)  Registration cards.--Registration cards and forms for
16  oaths shall be available at each polling place. If an individual
17  who registers on election day proves residence under section
18  301(b)(3), the form containing that statement shall be attached
19  to the individual's registration card. Registration cards
20  completed on election day shall be forwarded to the appropriate
21  county board, which shall add the name of each voter to the
22  registration rolls unless the information forwarded is
23  substantially deficient. Each judge of elections registering a
24  person on election day shall initial the voter registration card
25  of that individual.
26     (c)  Deficient registration.--A county board which finds an
27  election day registration substantially deficient shall mail
28  written notice of same to the individual. An election day
29  registration shall not be found deficient solely because the
30  individual who provided proof of residence was ineligible to do
1  so.
2  Section 303.  Maps.
3     The county board shall provide each polling place with a
4  detailed map showing election districts in order to assist
5  judges of elections in determining whether an address is located
6  in that district.
7  Section 304.  Record of attempted registrations.
8     The judge of elections responsible for election day
9  registration at each polling place shall keep a record of the
10  number of individuals who attempt to register on election day
11  but who cannot provide proof of residence as required by this
12  act. This record shall be forwarded to the county board with the
13  election returns for that election district.
14  Section 305.  Verification by mail.
15     Within ten days of an election, each county board shall send
16  a notice to a random sampling of no less than 25% of individuals
17  registered on election day. The random sampling shall be
18  determined in accordance with the rules of the department. As
19  soon as practicable after the election, the county board shall
20  mail registration verification notices to all individuals
21  registered on election day. If a notice is returned as not
22  deliverable, the county board shall attempt to determine the
23  reason for the return. A county board which does not receive or
24  obtain satisfactory proof of an individual's eligibility to vote
25  shall immediately notify the district attorney and the
26  department.
27                             CHAPTER 5
28                     ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES
29  Section 501.  Prohibited acts.
30     (a)  General.--A person may not do any of the following:
1         (1)  Cause an individual's name to be registered in any
2     election district if that individual is not eligible to vote.
3         (2)  Cause an individual's name to be registered for the
4     purpose of voting in more than one election district or in
5     any election district in which the individual does not
6     maintain residence.
7         (3)  Misrepresent an individual's identity when
8     attempting to register to vote.
9         (4)  Aid, abet, counsel or procure any other individual
10     to violate this act.
11     (b)  Judge of elections.--A judge of elections may not allow
12  an unregistered voter to vote in any election.
13     (c)  Grading.--A violation of this section constitutes a
14  misdemeanor of the second degree.
15  Section 502.  Enforcement.
16     Prosecution for violations of this act shall be brought by
17  the district attorney, upon information supplied by the
18  department, a county election officer or any person.
