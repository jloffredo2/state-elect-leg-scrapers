24  (P.L.526, No.213) and February 19, 1986 (P.L.29, No.11) and
25  repealed in part April 28, 1978 (P.L.202, No. 53), is amended to
26  read:
27     Section 976.  Examination of Nomination Petitions,
28  Certificates [and], Papers, Declarations; Return of Rejected
29  Nomination Petitions, Certificates [and], Papers, Declarations
30  of Candidacy for Nomination and Declarations of Candidacy for
1  Election.--When any nomination petition, nomination certificate
2  [or], nomination paper, declaration of candidacy for nomination
3  or declaration of candidacy for election is presented in the
4  office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth or of any county
5  board of elections for filing within the period limited by this
6  act, it shall be the duty of the said officer or board to
7  examine the same. No nomination petition, nomination paper [or],
8  nomination certificate, declaration of candidacy for nomination
9  or declaration of candidacy for election shall be permitted to
10  be filed if--(a) it contains material errors or defects apparent
11  on the face thereof, or on the face of the appended or
12  accompanying affidavits; or (b) in the case of a nomination
13  petition, nomination paper or nomination certificate, it
14  contains material alterations made after signing without the
15  consent of the signers; or (c) in the case of a nomination
16  petition, nomination paper or nomination certificate, it does
17  not contain a sufficient number of signatures as required by
18  law; Provided, however, That the Secretary of the Commonwealth
19  or the county board of elections, although not hereby required
20  so to do, may question the genuineness of any signature or
21  signatures appearing thereon, and if he or it shall thereupon
22  find that any such signature or signatures are not genuine, such
23  signature or signatures shall be disregarded in determining
24  whether the nomination petition, nomination paper or nomination
25  certificate contains a sufficient number of signatures as
26  required by law; or (d) in the case of nomination petitions or
27  declarations of candidacy for nomination, if nomination
28  petitions have been filed or a declaration of candidacy for
29  nomination has been filed for printing the name of the same
30  person for the same office, except the office of judge of a
1  court of common pleas, the Philadelphia Municipal Court or the
2  Traffic Court of Philadelphia, or the office of school director
3  in districts where that office is elective or the office of
4  justice of the peace upon the official ballot of more than one
5  political party; or (e) in the case of nomination papers or
6  declarations of candidacy for election, if the candidate named
7  therein has filed a nomination petition or a declaration of
8  candidacy for nomination for any public office for the ensuing
9  primary, or has been nominated for any such office by nomination
10  papers previously filed; or (f) if the nomination petitions or
11  papers are not accompanied by the filing fee or certified check
12  required for said office; or (f.1)  if the declaration of
13  candidacy for nomination or the declaration of candidacy for
14  election is not accompanied by the required declaration fee as
15  determined under section 912.3 or 952.1; or (g) in the case of
16  nomination papers or a declaration of candidacy for election,
17  the appellation set forth therein is identical with or
18  deceptively similar to the words used by any existing party or
19  by any political body which has already filed nomination papers
20  or by any candidate who has filed a declaration of candidacy for
21  election for the same office, or if the appellation set forth
22  therein contains part of the name, or an abbreviation of the
23  name or part of the name of an existing political party, or of a
24  political body which has already filed nomination papers for the
25  same office. The invalidity of any sheet of a nomination
26  petition or nomination paper shall not affect the validity of
27  such petition or paper if a sufficient petition or paper remains
28  after eliminating such invalid sheet. The action of said officer
29  or board in refusing to receive and file any such nomination
30  petition, certificate [or], paper, declaration of candidacy for
1  nomination or declaration of candidacy for election may be
2  reviewed by the court upon an application to compel its
3  reception as of the date when it was presented to the office of
4  such officer or board: Provided, however, That said officer or
5  board shall be entitled to a reasonable time in which to examine
6  any petitions, certificates [or], papers, declarations of
7  candidacy for nomination or declarations of candidacy for
8  election and to summon and interrogate the candidates named
9  therein, or the persons presenting said petitions, certificates
10  or papers, and his or their retention of same for the purpose of
11  making such examination or interrogation shall not be construed
12  as an acceptance or filing.
13     Upon completion of any examination, if any nomination
14  petition, certificate [or], paper, declaration of candidacy for
15  nomination or declaration of candidacy for election is found to
16  be defective, it shall forthwith be rejected and returned to the
17  candidate or one of the candidates named therein, together with
18  a statement of the reasons for such rejection:
19     Provided further, That no nomination petition, nomination
20  paper [or], nomination certificate, declaration of candidacy for
21  nomination or declaration of candidacy for election shall be
22  permitted to be filed, if the political party or political body
23  referred to therein shall be composed of a group of electors
24  whose purposes or aims, or one of whose purposes or aims, is the
25  establishment, control, conduct, seizure or overthrow of the
26  Government of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United
27  States of America by the use of force, violence, military
28  measure or threats of one or more of the foregoing. The
29  authority to reject such nomination petition, paper [or],
30  certificate, declaration of candidacy for nomination or
1  declaration of candidacy for election for this reason shall,
2  when filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth, be vested in
3  a committee composed of the Governor, the Attorney General and
4  the Secretary of the Commonwealth, and when filed with any
5  county board of elections shall be vested in such board. If in
6  such case the committee or board, as the case may be, shall
7  conclude that the acceptance of such nomination petition, paper
8  [or], certificate, declaration of candidacy for nomination or
9  declaration of candidacy for election should be refused, it
10  shall within two days of the filing of such nomination petition,
11  paper [or], certificate, declaration of candidacy for nomination
12  or declaration of candidacy for election fix a place and a time
13  five days in advance for hearing the matter, and notice thereof
14  shall be given to all parties affected thereby. At the time and
15  place so fixed the committee or board, as the case may be, shall
16  hear testimony, but shall not be bound by technical rules of
17  evidence. The testimony presented shall be stenographically
18  recorded and made a part of the record of the committee or
19  board. Within two days after such hearing the committee or
20  board, if satisfied upon competent evidence that the said
21  nomination petition, paper [or], certificate, declaration of
22  candidacy for nomination or declaration of candidacy for
23  election is not entitled to be accepted and filed, it shall
24  announce its decision and immediately notify the parties
25  affected thereby. Failure to announce decision within two days
26  after such hearing shall be conclusive that such nomination
27  petition, paper [or], certificate, declaration of candidacy for
28  nomination or declaration of candidacy for election has been
29  accepted and filed. The decision of said committee or board in
30  refusing to accept and file such nomination petition, paper
1  [or], certificate, declaration of candidacy for nomination or
2  declaration of candidacy for election may be reviewed by the
3  court upon an application to compel its reception as of the date
4  when presented to the Secretary of the Commonwealth or such
5  board. The application shall be made within two days of the time
6  when such decision is announced. If the application is properly
7  made, any judge of said court may fix a time and place for
8  hearing the matter in dispute, of which notice shall be served
9  with a copy of said application upon the Secretary of the
10  Commonwealth or the county board of elections, as the case may
11  be. At the time so fixed, the court, or any judge thereof
12  assigned for the purpose, shall hear the case de novo. If after
13  such hearing the said court shall find that the decision of the
14  committee or the board was erroneous, it shall issue its mandate
15  to the committee or board to correct its decision and to accept
16  and file the nomination paper, petition [or], certificate,
17  declaration of candidacy for nomination or declaration of
18  candidacy for election. From any decision of the court an appeal
19  may be taken within two days after the entry thereof. It shall
20  be the duty of the said court to fix the hearing and to announce
21  its decision within such period of time as will permit the
22  Secretary of the Commonwealth or the county board of elections
23  to permit the names of the candidates affected by the court's
24  decision to be printed on the ballot, if the court should so
25  determine.
26     Section 17.  Section 977 of the act, amended February 13,
27  1998 (P.L.72, No.18) and repealed in part April 28, 1978
28  (P.L.202, No.53), is amended to read:
29     Section 977.  Objections to Nomination Petitions and Papers,
30  and Declarations.--All nomination petitions and papers, and all
1  declarations of candidacy for nomination and declarations of
2  candidacy for election received and filed within the periods
3  limited by this act shall be deemed to be valid, unless, within
4  seven days after the last day for filing said nomination
5  petition [or], paper or declaration, a petition is presented to
6  the court specifically setting forth the objections thereto, and
7  praying that the said petition [or], paper or declaration of
8  candidacy be set aside. A copy of said petition shall, within
9  said period, be served on the officer or board with whom said
10  nomination petition [or], paper, or declaration of candidacy was
11  filed. Upon the presentation of such a petition, the court shall
12  make an order fixing a time for hearing which shall not be later
13  than ten days after the last day for filing said nomination
14  petition [or], paper, or declaration of candidacy, and
15  specifying the time and manner of notice that shall be given to
16  the candidate or candidates named in the nomination petition
17  [or], paper, or declaration of candidacy sought to be set aside.
18  On the day fixed for said hearing, the court shall proceed
19  without delay to hear said objections, and shall give such
20  hearing precedence over other business before it, and shall
21  finally determine said matter not later than fifteen (15) days
22  after the last day for filing said nomination petitions or
23  papers. If the court shall find that said nomination petition
24  [or], paper, or declaration of candidacy is defective under the
25  provisions of section 976, or, in the case of a nomination
26  petition or paper, does not contain a sufficient number of
27  genuine signatures of electors entitled to sign the same under
28  the provisions of this act, or was not filed by persons entitled
29  to file the same, it shall be set aside. If the objections
30  relate to material errors or defects apparent on the face of the
1  nomination petition [or], paper, or declaration of candidacy,
2  the court, after hearing, may, in its discretion, permit
3  amendments within such time and upon such terms as to payment of
4  costs, as the said court may specify. In case any such petition
5  is dismissed, the court shall make such order as to the payment
6  of the costs of the proceedings, including witness fees, as it
7  shall deem just. If a person shall sign any nomination petitions
8  or papers for a greater number of candidates than he is
9  permitted under the provisions of this act, if said signatures
10  bear the same date, they shall, upon objections filed thereto,
11  not be counted on any petition or paper and if they bear
