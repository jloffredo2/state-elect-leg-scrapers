17  3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election
18  Code, are amended to read:
19     Section 1501.  Election of Presidential Electors.--At the
20  general election to be held in the year 1940, and every fourth
21  year thereafter, there shall be elected by the qualified
22  electors of the Commonwealth, persons to be known as electors of
23  President and Vice-President of the United States, and referred
1  to in this act as presidential electors, equal in number to the
2  whole number of senators and representatives to which this State
3  may be entitled in the Congress of the United States. One
4  presidential elector shall be chosen from each congressional
5  district, and two presidential electors shall be chosen from the
6  Commonwealth at large.
7     Section 1502.  Meeting of Electors; Duties.--The electors
8  chosen, as aforesaid, shall assemble at the seat of government
9  of this Commonwealth, at 12 o'clock noon of the day which is, or
10  may be, directed by the Congress of the United States, and shall
11  then and there perform the duties enjoined upon them by the
12  Constitution and laws of the United States. The presidential
13  elector of each congressional district shall cast his ballot for
14  the presidential and vice-presidential candidates who received
15  the largest number of votes in that congressional district, and
16  the presidential electors at large shall cast their ballots for
17  the presidential and vice-presidential candidates who received
18  the largest number of votes in the Commonwealth.
19     Section 1503.  Filling of Vacancies Existing in Presidential
20  Electors.--If any such presidential elector shall die, or for
21  any cause fail to attend at the seat of government at the time
22  appointed by law, the electors present shall proceed to choose
23  viva voce a person of the same political party as such deceased
24  or absent elector, to fill the vacancy occasioned thereby, and
25  immediately after such choice the name of the person so chosen
26  shall be transmitted by the presiding officer of the college to
27  the Governor, who shall forthwith cause notice in writing to be
28  given to such person of his election; and the person so elected
29  (and not the person in whose place he shall have been chosen)
30  shall be an elector and shall, with the other electors, perform
1  the duties enjoined on them. A presidential elector so elected
2  shall cast his ballot for the same presidential and vice-
3  presidential candidates as required of the person in whose place
