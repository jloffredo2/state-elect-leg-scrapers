19  Circulating.--Each signer of a nomination petition shall sign
20  but one such petition for each office to be filled, and shall
21  declare therein that he is a registered and enrolled member of
22  the party designated in such petition: Provided, however, That
1  where there are to be elected two or more persons to the same
2  office, each signer may sign petitions for as many candidates
3  for such office as, and no more than, he could vote for at the
4  succeeding election. He shall also declare therein that he is a
5  qualified elector of the county therein named, and in case the
6  nomination is not to be made or candidates are not to be elected
7  by the electors of the State at large, of the political district
8  therein named, in which the nomination is to be made or the
9  election is to be held. He shall add his [occupation and]
10  residence, giving city, borough or township, with street and
11  number, if any, and shall print and sign his name and add the
12  date of signing, expressed in words or numbers: Provided,
13  however, That if the said political district named in the
14  petition lies wholly within any city, borough or township, or is
15  coextensive with same, it shall not be necessary for any signer
16  of a nomination petition to state therein the city, borough or
17  township of his residence. No nomination petition shall be
18  circulated prior to the thirteenth Tuesday before the primary,
19  and no signature shall be counted unless it bears a date affixed
20  not earlier than the thirteenth Tuesday nor later than the tenth
21  Tuesday prior to the primary.
22     Section 2.  This act shall take effect immediately.
