9     Section 1.  Sections 901 and 1903 of the act of June 30, 1995
10  (P.L.170, No.25), known as the Pennsylvania Voter Registration
11  Act, are amended to read:
12  Section 901.  Removal notices.
13     (a)  Form.--
14         (1)  The commission shall make removal notices available
15     to electors who are registered in the county.
16         (2)  The notice shall be printed upon cards suitable for
17     mailing, addressed to the office of the commission. The
18     notice shall provide the following information:
1             (i)  The address of present residence, including
2         municipality.
3             (ii)  The address of last registration, including
4         municipality.
5             (iii)  Date of removal to present residence.
6             (iv)  Signature.
7         (3)  The notice shall contain a statement that the
8     elector may, by filling out properly and signing a removal
9     notice and returning it to the office of the commission,
10     secure the transfer of registration effective as to elections
11     at least 30 days after the date of removal into the new
12     district.
13         (4)  The notice shall contain a warning to the elector
14     that the notice will not be accepted as an application for
15     transfer of the elector's registration unless the signature
16     thereon can be identified by the commission as the elector's
17     signature as it appears on file with the commission.
18         (5)  The notice shall contain a warning to the elector
19     that the notice must be received by the commission not later
20     than 30 days before the election. If mailed, the notice must
21     be postmarked not later than the deadline for registration
22     or, in the case of an illegible or missing postmark, received
23     within five days of the close of registration.
24     (b)  Use.--An elector who removes residence from one place to
25  another within the same county must notify the commission by
26  filing a removal notice under subsection (a), or a signed
27  request for renewal that contains the information required in
28  subsection (a), with the commission not later than the
29  registration deadline before the election. If mailed, the notice
30  or request must be postmarked not later than the deadline for
1  registration or, in the case of an illegible or missing
2  postmark, received within five days of the close of
3  registration. The following apply:
4         (1)  An official registration application of an elector
5     who has registered by mail qualifies as a removal notice.
6         (2)  An elector who removes residence from one place to
7     another within the same county and who has not yet filed a
8     removal notice with the commission shall be permitted to vote
9     [at the election next following removal if, at the time of
10     signing voter's certificate, the elector files with the judge
11     of election a signed removal notice properly filled out.
12     Removal notices under this paragraph shall be returned to the
13     commission with the voting check list, and the commission
14     shall proceed to transfer the registration of the electors
15     under section 902.] in accordance with sections 1902 and
16     1903.
17  Section 1903.  Incorrect records and provisional ballots.
18     [If] (a)  General rule.--If an elector claims to be properly
19  registered in the area covered by the polling place and eligible
20  to vote at the precinct in the election, but his or her
21  eligibility cannot be determined, or if registration records
22  incorrectly indicate that an elector has moved from an address
23  in the area covered by a polling place, the elector shall, upon
24  written affirmation before an election official at that polling
25  place, be permitted to vote at that polling place[.] using a
26  provisional ballot. Once voted, a provisional ballot shall be
27  placed in an envelope in a form prescribed by the secretary and
28  substantially in the format required for absentee ballots under
29  section 1304 of the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320),
30  known as the Pennsylvania Election Code.
1     (b)  Form.--The provisional ballot affirmation shall be in
2  substantially the following form:

15         Additional information may be provided to further assist
16         the judge of elections in determining eligibility. If
17         known, please provide the place and date that you
18         registered...............................................
19     (c)  Alternate rule.--In counties where the voting system
20  does not utilize paper ballots, the judge of elections shall
21  provide the appropriate provisional ballot at each polling place
22  in accordance with regulations issued by the secretary.
23     (d)  Hearing.--Provisional ballots shall be returned to the
24  county board with the returns of the local election district
25  where they shall be placed unopened in a secure, safe and sealed
26  container in the custody of the county board until it shall fix
27  a time and place for a formal hearing of all such ballots. A
28  formal hearing shall be held of all such provisional ballots and
29  notice shall be given to all electors thus submitting
30  provisional ballots and to every attorney, watcher or candidate
1  in the same manner as hearings for challenged absentee ballots
2  under section 1308(e) of the Pennsylvania Election Code. At such
3  hearing, the county board shall examine each provisional ballot
4  to determine if the person voting that ballot was entitled to
5  vote at the precinct in the election and that the person had not
6  already cast a ballot in the election.
7     (e)  Signature.--If it is determined that the person was
8  registered and entitled to vote at the precinct in the election,
9  the county board shall compare the signature on the provisional
10  ballot envelope with the signature on the voter's registration
11  and, if it matches, shall count the ballot. If it is determined
12  that the person was registered and entitled to vote at another
13  precinct in the election, the county board shall compare the
14  signature on the provisional ballot envelope with the signature
15  on the voter's registration and, if it matches, shall count the
16  ballot for all offices the person was eligible to vote for.
17     (f)  Rejection.--If it is determined that the person voting
18  the provisional ballot was not registered or entitled to vote in
19  the county at the election, the provisional ballot shall not be
20  counted and the ballot shall remain in an envelope marked
21  "Rejected and illegal."
22     (g)  Addition.--Upon completion of the computation of the
23  returns of the county, the votes cast upon provisional ballots
24  shall be added to the other votes cast within the election
25  district.
26     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
