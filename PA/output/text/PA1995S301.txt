20         (3)  An individual shall not be considered to have gained

24     of abode.
25         (4)  If an individual removes to another state with the
26     intention of making that state the permanent residence, the
27     individual shall be considered to have lost residence in this
28     Commonwealth.
29         (5)  If an individual removes to another state with the
30     intention of remaining there an indefinite time and making
1     that state the place of residence, the individual shall be
2     considered to have lost residence in this Commonwealth,
3     notwithstanding an intention to return at some indefinite
4     future period.
5         (6)  If an individual goes into another state and, while

8     Commonwealth.
9         (7)  An individual employed in the service of the Federal
10     Government or of the Commonwealth and required thereby to be
11     absent from the municipality where the individual resided
12     when entering that employment, and the spouse of the

25         the employment. The commission shall retain certificates
26         under this subparagraph.
27             (ii)  The commission shall note on the registration
28         card of each individual registered under this paragraph
29         the fact of Federal or State employment.

4         Federal or State employee, the individual's registration
5         shall be canceled under Chapter 9.

11         Such notices must be sent by first class nonforwardable
12         mail, return postage guaranteed, and must be in a form
13         approved by the secretary and designed in such a manner
14         to allow the registrant to indicate that the address
15         change is incorrect, the reason why such discrepancy

1  elector is ineligible to register to vote under this section.

5  identification card application.
6     (f)  Use of information.--No information regarding a
7  declination to register to vote in connection with an

9  other than voter registration.
10     (g)  Staff.--Agents and employees working on behalf of the
11  Department of Transportation assisting in the completion of
12  voter registration applications shall conduct themselves in a
13  manner consistent with the following principles:
14         (1)  They shall not seek to influence an applicant's
15     political preference or party registration or display
16     political preference or party allegiance.
17         (2)  They shall not make a statement to an applicant or

2  registration may be submitted by voter registration mail
3  application in the manner set forth in this section. An
4  application may be submitted by mail or by representative to the
5  registration commission on an official mail registration
6  application, the form of which shall be determined and
7  prescribed by the secretary or the Federal Election Commission

11  application and sign the registration declaration.
12     (b)  Time.--Registration under this section may be made at
13  any time. If a registration application is received by a

26     address, the elector had not resided in this Commonwealth or
27     in a particular election district for a sufficient time to
28     have been entitled to be registered but, by continued
29     residence, would have become entitled to be registered, the
30     elector shall be entitled to be registered at the time the
1     elector would have been entitled to register had the elector
2     not left that home address but continued to reside there.
3         (3)  The commission is authorized to consider a request
4     for an absentee ballot as a request for an official

4     where you live now, would you like to apply to register to

9     be provided by this agency."
10         (3)  Boxes for the applicant to check to indicate whether
11     the applicant would like to register or decline to register
12     to vote. In close proximity to the boxes the following words
13     shall appear in prominent type: "IF YOU DO NOT CHECK EITHER
14     BOX, YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE DECIDED NOT TO REGISTER

16         (4)  The statement, "If you would like help in filling
17     out the voter registration application form, we will help
18     you. The decision whether to seek help is yours. You may fill

20         (5)  The statement, "If you believe that someone has
21     interfered with your right to register or to decline to
22     register to vote, your right to privacy in deciding whether

9     take any action the purpose or effect of which is to lead the
10     applicant to believe that a decision to register or not to
11     register has any bearing on the availability of services or
12     benefits.
13  Agency employees who violate this subsection shall be removed
14  from employment, provided that the agency at its discretion may

11  form as is provided by the office with regard to the completion
12  of its own forms, unless the applicant refuses such assistance.

27     applicant's choice other than the applicant's employer or an
28     agent of the applicant's union. Such person shall insert the
29     person's name, address and telephone number. If such person
30     is an employee or agent of the Department of Transportation
1     or another agency, as provided under section 525, and is
2     assisting the applicant in an official capacity, such
3     employee or agent shall insert the initials and
4     identification number of the employee or agent. In the case
5     of applicants registering under section 523 or 525, the
6     person providing assistance shall insert initials or employee
7     or agent identification number on a separate or detachable
8     portion of the application or computer data file.
9         (4)  The official registration application shall contain
10     a notice entitled "PENALTY FOR FALSIFYING DECLARATION." The
11     notice shall advise the applicant that, if a person signs an
12     official registration application knowing a statement
13     declared in the application to be false, the person commits
14     perjury. The notice shall specify the penalty for perjury.

17     applications to commissions.

14     registration office. Along with the distribution of such
15     applications, the secretary shall also include instructions

3  Section 528.  Approval of registration applications.

5         (1)  Official registration applications submitted to a
6     registration commission shall be examined by the commissioner
7     or a clerk or registrar upon receipt.
8         (2)  If the official voter registration application
9     submission is in person, the application shall be attested
10     and dated by the commissioner, clerk or registrar.
11         (3)  Upon receipt of any other voter registration
12     application, the commission shall make an entry of the date
13     received on the application. If the applicant does not reside
14     within the commission's county, but resides elsewhere in this
15     Commonwealth, the commission shall forward the application
16     card to the proper commission and make a record of the
17     forwarding.
18     (b)  Decision.--
19         (1)  If the commission finds the official registration
20     application not properly completed, the application shall be
21     rejected. The commission should make reasonable efforts to
22     complete the registration before rejecting it for omissions
23     and inconsistencies. If the commission rejects an application
24     under this paragraph, it shall indicate "REJECTED" on the
25     application and state there the reason for rejection and
26     notify the applicant by first class nonforwardable mail,
27     return postage guaranteed.
28         (2)  If the official registration application contains
29     the required information indicating that the applicant is
30     legally qualified to register as stated in the application,
1     the commission shall mail to the applicant a voter's
2     identification card in accordance with subsection (d)(1).
3         (3)  For an application for a transfer of registration or
4     a change in address or name, if the application contains the
5     required information and the applicant is legally qualified
6     to transfer registration or change name or address as stated
7     in the application, the commission shall make the transfer or
8     change. If the commission suspects that the applicant is not
9     entitled to transfer registration or to change name or
10     address, the commission may investigate. If the commission
11     finds that the applicant is not entitled to the transfer or
12     change, the application shall be rejected. The applicant
13     shall be notified of the rejection and the reason for it.
14     Rejection shall be made no later than ten days before the
15     election succeeding the filing of the application.
16     (c)  Result.--If an application is designed to serve as a
17  registration card, the accepted application of an elector may
18  serve as the elector's official registration card, if it was so
19  designed, and shall be filed in the office of the commission in
20  accordance with Chapter 7. If the application is not designed to
21  serve as a registration card, the information contained on the
22  application, including the elector's signature, shall be
23  transferred to the registration card. If a commission utilizes a
24  signature digitization list, it shall transfer all information
25  contained on the application, including the signature, to the
26  registry or, until the registry is established, to a computer
27  file. The right of an individual to be registered shall not be
28  subject to challenge for any reason other than failure to have
29  furnished the commission a properly completed registration
30  application. Applicants for registration shall be challenged
1  under section 529.
2     (d)  Disposition.--
3         (1)  When the registration of an elector has been finally
4     processed under subsection (b)(2), the commission shall
5     transmit to the applicant by first-class nonforwardable mail
6     a wallet-sized voter's identification card, which shall serve
7     as notice to the applicant of the disposition of the
8     application. The card shall contain all of the following:
9             (i)  Name and address of the elector.
10             (ii)  Name of municipality.
11             (iii)  Identification of elector's ward and district.
12             (iv)  Effective date of registration.
13             (v)  Designation of party enrollment and date of
14         enrollment.
15             (vi)  A space for the elector's signature or mark.
16             (vii)  A statement that the card relates only to the
17         time of issuance of the card and is not of itself
18         evidence or proof of the qualifications of the elector to
19         vote at an election and that it is not necessary to
20         present the card when voting. The statements required by
21         this subparagraph shall be placed on the reverse side of
22         the card from where all of the other information required
23         by this paragraph is placed.
24         (2)  The carrier envelope in which the identification
25     card is enclosed shall contain on the outside a request to
26     the postmaster to return it within five days if it cannot be
27     delivered to the addressee at the address given.
28         (3)  No registration application shall be deemed to be
29     accepted until ten days after the voter's identification card
30     has been mailed. Upon return by the post office of an
1     identification card under paragraph (2) which the post office
2     is unable to deliver at the given address, the commission
3     shall investigate. If the commission finds that the applicant
4     is not qualified to register from such address, the
5     commission shall reject the application of the applicant and
6     shall notify the applicant by first class forwardable mail of
7     this action.
8         (4)  If the applicant discloses that the elector's last
9     residence address upon registration was a location within
10     another county, the commission shall direct a cancellation
11     notice to the commission of that county. This cancellation
12     notice shall be in a form approved by the secretary in
13     substantially the following form:
14         Date .........................

8                              RECORDS
9  Section 701.  General register.
10     (a)  Original registration cards.--If a commission uses the
11  original registration cards for registered electors in the
12  county as the district register, the duplicate registration
13  cards or photocopies of the original registration cards shall be
14  placed in exact alphabetical order by last name of the
15  registrant, shall be indexed and shall be kept at the office of
16  the registration commission in a manner as to be properly
17  safeguarded. These cards constitute the general register of the
18  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
19  commission except upon order of a court of record. Nothing in
20  this act shall preclude the use of duplicate registration cards
21  from applications provided under the act of March 30, 1937
22  (P.L.115, No.40), known as The First Class City Permanent
23  Registration Act, or the act of April 29, 1937 (P.L.487,
24  No.115), known as The Permanent Registration Act for Cities of
25  the Second Class, Cities of the Second Class A, Cities of the
26  Third Class, Boroughs, Towns, and Townships.
27     (b)  Digitized signature lists.--If a commission uses
28  digitized signature lists as the district register, the original
29  registration cards shall be placed in exact alphabetical order
30  by last name of the registrant, indexed and kept at the office
1  of the commission in a manner as to be properly safeguarded.
2  These original cards constitute the general register of the
3  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
4  commission except upon order of a court of record. The
5  commission shall safely retain all registration cards used in
6  the registration of electors or in conducting an election. If a
7  commission has the capability to accept an electronic
8  application, the secretary may require the commission to produce
9  a computer-generated card to file in the general register. If
10  the commission finds a record for a registrant on the computer
11  data base which is not contained in the general register, it
12  shall replace the original card with a computer-generated
13  duplicate card upon written permission from the registrant or
14  upon order of a court of record.
15     (c)  Duplicate files.--If the commission deems a duplicate
16  file of registration cards necessary for administrative
17  purposes, the commission may prepare a reproduction in
18  compliance with the following:
19         (1)  The registration form shall be photographed,
20     microphotographed or reproduced in a manner approved for
21     permanent records by the secretary.
22         (2)  The device used to reproduce the card is one which
23     accurately reproduces the original in all details.
24         (3)  The photographs, microphotographs or other
25     reproductions are open to public inspection and provision is
26     made for preserving, examining and using them.
27  Section 702.  District registers.
28     (a)  Registration card file.--
29         (1)  Except as provided in subsection (b) and in section
30     701(b), the original registration cards shall be filed by
1     election districts in exact alphabetical order by last name
2     of the registrant and shall be indexed.
3         (2)  The cards constitute the district register.
4         (3)  The commission shall provide binders, which are
5     capable of being locked, for filing and indexing the
6     registration cards. The keys to the binders shall at all
7     times be retained by the commission.
8         (4)  The district register shall be kept at the office of
9     the commission, except as provided in subsection (b), and
10     shall be open to public inspection, subject to reasonable
11     safeguards and regulations.
12     (b)  Computer lists.--
13         (1)  Prior to full implementation of a Statewide central
14     registry under section 301, instead of using registration
15     cards as the district register as provided in subsection (a),
16     a commission may use a computer list or computer-generated
17     cards containing the registered electors arranged by election
18     district, alphabetically by last name of the registrant.
19         (2)  After the full implementation of a Statewide central
20     registry under section 301, instead of using original
21     registration cards as the district register as provided in
22     subsection (a), a commission shall use a computer list or
23     computer-generated cards in a format as prescribed by the
24     secretary by regulation.
25         (3)  The computer list or computer-generated cards must
26     be in a form prescribed by the secretary and must contain
27     necessary information that would otherwise be available on
28     the registration cards, including a legible digitized
29     signature of the registrant copied from the signature on the
30     registration card. The district election officials shall have
1     computer printouts at the polling places containing the
2     necessary information needed to verify the identity of the
3     elector. The digitized signature list shall be open to public
4     inspection, subject to reasonable safeguards, rules and
5     regulations.
6         (4)  A commission may, during systems conversion periods
7     or emergency conditions, provide for a district register
8     containing the original registration cards. The following
9     apply:
10             (i)  The original registration cards shall be filed
11         by election district, in one of the following orders, as
12         determined by the commission:
13                 (A)  Exact alphabetical order by last name of
14             registrant.
15                 (B)  Order in which registrants' residences
16             appear upon the streets of the election district, in
17             exact alphabetical order by last name of registrant
18             for each residence.
19             (ii)  The district register containing registration
20         cards shall be kept at the office of the commission and
21         shall be open for public inspection, subject to
22         reasonable safeguards and regulations and to the
23         provisions of this act.
24     (c)  Currency.--It is the duty of the commission to compare
25  and correct the general register and district registers to
26  ensure their accuracy. By noon of the third day preceding an
27  election, the commission shall have the district register for
28  each election district and the registry accurately corrected to
29  date.
30     (d)  Delivery.--The commission shall deliver, in the manner
1  required by law for delivery of election materials, the district
2  register to the election officers for use on election day.
3     (e)  Form.--District registers shall be enclosed within a
4  case or container and shall be locked and sealed by the
5  commission before delivery. The district register shall have
6  printed or written thereon the words "District Register of
7  Voters" and the district and ward, if any.
8     (f)  Examination.--Immediately following each election, the
9  commission shall cause each district register to be examined.
10  The commission specifically shall compare the signature of each
11  elector on each voter's certificate with his signature in the
12  district register and shall report in writing to the district
13  attorney any evidence or indication of probable fraud,
14  impersonation or forgery which may appear to the commission by
15  reason of the comparison. In the case of any elector whom the
16  election officers shall have recorded as removed, deceased, or
17  challenged and prevented from voting, the commission shall
18  ascertain the facts and shall correct the general and district
19  registers in accordance with Chapter 9.
20  Section 703.  Street lists.
21     (a)  Preparation.--Commencing not later than the 15th day
22  prior to each election, the registration commission shall
23  prepare for each election district a list of the names and
24  addresses of all registered electors as of that date resident in
25  the district. The list may not include the digitized signature
26  of a registered voter. The list shall be arranged in one of the
27  following manners:
28         (1)  By streets and house numbers.
29         (2)  Alphabetically by last name of registrant.

15     (a)  Establishment.--
16         (1)  The registration commission may and, once a registry
17     is established, shall provide for computer inquiries
18     concerning individual registered voters. With respect to each
19     voter who is the subject of an inquiry, the information
20     provided shall contain the name, address, year of birth and
21     voting history. Upon request, the commission shall supply a

24     for inspection a printed or computerized public information
25     list containing the name, address, year of birth and voting
26     history of each registered voter in the county.
27         (2)  The list may also include information on voting
28     districts.
29         (3)  The list may not contain the digitized signature of

7     names of registered voters from the list may use information
8     contained in the list for purposes unrelated to elections,
9     political activities or law enforcement. Before inspecting
10     the list or obtaining names of voters or other information
11     from the list, the individual must provide identification to
12     the public official having custody of the public information
13     list and must state in writing that any information obtained
14     from the list will not be used for purposes unrelated to
15     elections, political activities or law enforcement.
16         (4)  The secretary may provide copies of public
17     information lists and other information from the registry for
18     uses related to elections or political activities or in
19     response to a law enforcement inquiry from a public official
20     concerning a failure to comply with any criminal statute or

22     information from the public information lists or the registry
23     must be made and processed in the manner provided in the

14     (a)  Form.--
15         (1)  The commission shall make removal notices available
16     to electors who are registered in the county.
17         (2)  The notice shall be printed upon cards suitable for
18     mailing, addressed to the office of the commission. The

20             (i)  The address of present residence, including
21         municipality.
22             (ii)  The address of last registration, including
23         municipality.
24             (iii)  Date of removal to present residence.
25             (iv)  Signature.
26         (3)  The notice shall contain a statement that the
27     elector may, by filling out properly and signing a removal
28     notice and returning it to the office of the commission,
29     secure the transfer of registration, effective as to
30     elections at least 30 days after the date of removal into the
1     new district.
2         (4)  The notice shall contain a warning to the elector
3     that the notice will not be accepted as an application for
4     transfer of the elector's registration unless the signature
5     thereon can be identified by the commission as the elector's
6     signature as it appears on file with the commission.
7         (5)  The notice shall contain a warning to the elector
8     that the notice must be received by the commission not later
9     than 30 days before the election. If mailed, the notice must
10     be postmarked not later than the deadline for registration
11     or, in the case of an illegible or missing postmark, received

13     (b)  Use.--An elector who removes residence from one place to
14  another within the same county must notify the commission by

16  request for renewal that contains the information required in
17  subsection (a), with the commission not later than the
18  registration deadline before the election. If mailed, the notice
19  or request must be postmarked not later than the deadline for
20  registration or, in the case of an illegible or missing
21  postmark, received within five days of the close of
22  registration. The following apply:
23         (1)  An official registration application of an elector
24     who has registered by mail qualifies as a removal notice.
25         (2)  An elector who removes residence from one place to
26     another within the same county and who has not yet filed a
27     removal notice with the commission shall be permitted to vote
28     at the election next following removal if, at the time of
29     signing voter's certificate, the elector files with the judge
30     of election a signed removal notice properly filled out.
1     Removal notices under this paragraph shall be returned to the
2     commission with the voting check list, and the commission
3     shall proceed to transfer the registration of the electors
4     under section 902.
5  Section 902.  Transfer of registration.
6     (a)  General rule.--Upon timely receipt of notification of
7  removal under section 901(b), the registration commission shall
8  proceed as follows:
9         (1)  The signature on the notification document shall be
10     compared with the signature of the elector as it appears on
11     file with the commission.
12         (2)  If the signature appears authentic, the commission
13     shall enter the change of residence on the registration card
14     of the elector in the general register and district register
15     and shall transfer the registration card of the elector from
16     the district register of the election district of previous
17     residence to the district register of the election district
18     of new residence.
19         (3)  If a request for transfer which is determined to be
20     authentic under paragraph (2) shows a removal within the
21     period of 30 days preceding an election, the commission,
22     after such election, shall enter the change of residence on
23     the registration card of the elector in the general register
24     and district register and shall transfer the registration
25     card of the elector from the district register of the
26     election district of previous residence. The commission shall
27     advise the elector promptly in writing of its action.
28     (b)  Electors unable to write.--An elector who is unable to
29  sign the notification document may affix a mark to the
30  notification document. The mark must be affixed in the presence
1  of a witness, who must sign the notification document.
2  Section 903.  Change of enrollment of political party.
3     By the deadline for registration, a registered voter who
4  desires to change the enrollment of political designation or
5  who, although registered, has not previously enrolled as a
6  member of a party may appear before a commissioner, registrar or
7  clerk or may submit an application by mail under section 524 and
8  state in a signed writing the political party in which the voter
9  desires to be enrolled. If the signature of the elector is
10  verified by comparison with the elector's signature as it
11  appears on file with the commission, the commissioner, registrar
12  or clerk shall make the change in the general register and
13  district register. If supported by other evidence of identity, a
14  mark may be made in lieu of a signature by an elector who is
15  unable to write. The mark must be made in the presence of a
16  witness, who must sign the registration application.
17  Section 904.  Physical disability.
18     (a)  Eligibility.--If an elector is unable to see or mark the
19  ballot or operate the voting machine or to enter the voting
20  compartment or voting machine booth without assistance, the

22         (1)  The elector may, at least ten days prior to the next
23     election, personally make application to the commission or a

25         (2)  The application must request the entry of the exact
26     nature of the disability on the elector's registration card.
27         (3)  The commission shall make the entry as appropriate.
28         (4)  If the disability is not entered on the registration
29     card, the elector may receive assistance if the elector
30     completes a declaration in the polling place under section
1     1218 of the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as
2     the Pennsylvania Election Code.
3     (b)  Termination.--If the commission ascertains that an
4  elector who has declared need for assistance is no longer in
5  need of assistance, it shall cancel on the registration card the
6  entry relating to illiteracy or physical disability which
7  authorized assistance. The commission shall notify the elector
8  by mail of its action.
9  Section 905.  Department of Health.
10     The registration commission shall cancel the registration of

29  the commission, all cases of residence property managed by them
30  which have been vacated by the tenant. The report shall include,
1  if known, the name of the tenant and the address to which the
2  tenant has removed.

6  Section 907.  Removal of voters.
7     (a)  Removal of elector's registration record.--Commissions
8  shall institute a program to protect the integrity of the
9  electoral process and to ensure the maintenance of accurate and
10  current voter registration records. An elector's registration
11  shall not be canceled except as follows:
12         (1)  At the request of the elector.
13         (2)  Upon the death of the elector under section 905.
14         (3)  Under a voter removal program as provided for under
15     subsection (b).
16     (b)  Voter removal program.--
17         (1)  The commission shall establish a program to identify
18     electors whose address may have changed by establishing one
19     of the following programs:
20             (i)  National change of address. The secretary shall
21         establish a program whereby information supplied by the
22         United States Postal Service through its licensees is
23         used to identify electors who may have changed addresses.
24         The information shall be incorporated in the
25         administration of the Statewide central registry and
26         shall be forwarded to the commissions in a manner
27         determined by the secretary by regulation.
28                 (A)  If it appears from the information provided
29             through the United States Postal Service that an
30             elector has moved to a different residence address
1             within the same county as the elector is currently
2             registered, the commission shall change the
3             registration records to show the new address and
4             shall send the elector a notice of the change of
5             address by forwardable mail and a postage prepaid
6             preaddressed return form by which the elector may
7             verify or correct the address information.
8                 (B)  If it appears from the information provided
9             through the United States Postal Service that an
10             elector has moved to a different residence address
11             outside the county, the commission shall use the
12             notice procedure described in clause (A).
13             (ii)  Confirmation mailing:
14                 (A)  A commission may establish a program by
15             sending a direct, nonforwardable first class "return
16             if undeliverable - address correction requested"
17             mailing to all registered electors in the county.
18                 (B)  If this program is established, the
19             commission shall use the notice procedure described
20             in subparagraph (i)(A) for any elector whose mailing
21             is returned undeliverable.
22         (2)  In conjunction with, and not as an alternative to, a
23     program established under paragraph (1), a canvass may be
24     used as follows:
25             (i)  The registration commission may, by
26         commissioners or by inspectors of registration, verify
27         the registration in an election district by visiting the
28         building from which an elector is registered and other
29         buildings as the commission deems necessary.
30             (ii)  The commission shall make a record of the name
1         and address of each registered elector who is found not
2         to reside at the registered address or who, for any other
3         reason, appears to be not qualified to vote in the
4         registered election district.
5             (iii)  The commission shall leave at the address of
6         each person referred to in subparagraph (ii) a notice
7         requiring him to communicate with the commission on or
8         before a date which the commission shall designate, and
9         which shall be not less than seven days and not more than
10         15 days from the date of the notice and in any case not
11         later than the 15th day preceding the election next
12         ensuing, and satisfy the commission of his qualifications
13         as an elector. The commission shall cause a confirmation
14         of each such notice to be sent by mail promptly to such
15         person at the address from which he is registered. The
16         envelope containing such information is to be plainly
17         marked that it is not to be forwarded. At the expiration
18         of the time specified in the notice, the commission shall
19         cancel or suspend the registration of such person who has
20         not communicated with the commission and proved his
21         qualifications as an elector.
22             (iv)  To facilitate the canvass under this section,
23         the commission may, when necessary, appoint special
24         inspectors of registration, in number not exceeding
25         double the number of election districts being canvassed.
26             (v)  Special inspectors must be qualified electors of
27         the county. They shall be appointed without reference to
28         residence in election districts or to political
29         affiliations or beliefs. The commission shall instruct
30         special inspectors in their duties. Special inspectors
1         have the powers conferred by this act upon inspectors of
2         registration.
3         (3)  In conjunction with, and not as an alternative to, a
4     program established under paragraph (1), the commission shall
5     send a notice pursuant to subsection (d) to any elector who
6     has not voted nor appeared to vote during the period
7     beginning five years before the date of the notice and ending
8     on the date of the notice and for whom the board of elections
9     did not during that period in any other way receive any
10     information that the voter still resides in the registered
11     election district.
12         (4)  Commissions shall complete, not later than 90 days
13     before each primary, voter removal programs under this
14     section. This paragraph shall not be construed to preclude
15     any of the following:
16             (i)  Cancellation of an elector's registration as
17         provided for under subsection (a)(1) or (2).
18             (ii)  Correction of registration records in
19         accordance with this act.
20     (c)  Identification of inactive voters.--A commission shall
21  mark an "I" on the registration card of each elector who has
22  been mailed a form under subsection (b)(1) and has failed to
23  respond.
24     (d)  Cancellation of registration.--
25         (1)  A commission shall not cancel the registration of an
26     elector on the ground that the elector has changed residence
27     unless any of the following apply:
28             (i)  The elector confirms in writing that the elector
29         has changed residence to a location outside the county in
30         which the elector is registered.
1             (ii)  The elector:

5             necessary, corrected the commission's record of the
6             elector's address, in an election during the period
7             beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the
8             day after the date of the second general election for
9             Federal office that occurs after the date of the
10             notice.
11         (2)  A notice, as required in paragraph (1)(ii), is
12     acceptable if it is a postage prepaid and preaddressed return
13     card, sent by forwardable mail, on which the elector may
14     state the elector's current address, if it contains a notice
15     as follows:
16             (i)  The notice must state all of the following:
17                 (A)  If the elector did not change residence or
18             changed residence but still resides in the county,
19             the elector must return the card not later than 30
20             days prior to the next election. If the card is not
21             returned, affirmation or confirmation of the
22             elector's address may be required before the elector
23             is permitted to vote in an election during the period
24             beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the
25             day after the date of the second general election for
26             Federal office that occurs after the date of the
27             notice. If the elector does not vote in an election
28             during that period, the elector's registration shall
29             be canceled.
30                 (B)  If the elector has changed residence to a
1             place outside the county in which the elector is
2             registered, information shall be provided concerning
3             how the elector can register in the new county of
4             residence.
5             (ii)  The notice must state the date of the notice,
6         the date of the next election and the date of the second
