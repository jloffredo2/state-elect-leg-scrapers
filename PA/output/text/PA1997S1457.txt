20  but one such petition for each office to be filled, and shall
21  declare therein that he is a registered and enrolled member of
22  the party designated in such petition: Provided, however, That
23  where there are to be elected two or more persons to the same
1  office, each signer may sign petitions for as many candidates
2  for such office as, and no more than, he could vote for at the
3  succeeding election. In addition to the signature, each signer
4  shall also print his name. He shall also declare therein that he
5  is a qualified elector of the county therein named, and in case
6  the nomination is not to be made or candidates are not to be
7  elected by the electors of the State at large, of the political
8  district therein named, in which the nomination is to be made or
9  the election is to be held. He shall add his [occupation and]
10  residence, giving city, borough or township, with street and
11  number, if any, and shall add the date of signing, expressed in
12  words or numbers: Provided, however, That if the said political
13  district named in the petition lies wholly within any city,
14  borough or township, or is coextensive with same, it shall not
15  be necessary for any signer of a nomination petition to state
16  therein the city, borough or township of his residence. No
17  nomination petition shall be circulated prior to the thirteenth
18  Tuesday before the primary, and no signature shall be counted
19  unless it bears a date affixed not earlier than the thirteenth
