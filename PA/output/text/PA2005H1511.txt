17  (P.L.526, No.213) and February 19, 1986 (P.L.29, No.11) and

19  read:
20     Section 976.  Examination of Nomination Petitions,
21  Certificates and Papers; Return of Rejected Nomination
22  Petitions, Certificates and Papers.--When any nomination
23  petition, nomination certificate or nomination paper is
24  presented in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth or
25  of any county board of elections for filing within the period
26  limited by this act, it shall be the duty of the said officer or
27  board to examine the same. No nomination petition, nomination
28  paper or nomination certificate shall be permitted to be filed
29  if--(a) it contains material errors or defects apparent on the
30  face thereof, or on the face of the appended or accompanying
1  affidavits; or (b) it contains material alterations made after
2  signing without the consent of the signers; or (c) it does not
3  contain a sufficient number of signatures as required by law;
4  Provided, however, That the Secretary of the Commonwealth or the
5  county board of elections, although not hereby required so to
6  do, may question the genuineness of any signature or signatures
7  appearing thereon, and if he or it shall thereupon find that any
8  such signature or signatures are not genuine, such signature or
9  signatures shall be disregarded in determining whether the
10  nomination petition, nomination paper or nomination certificate
11  contains a sufficient number of signatures as required by law;
12  or (d) in the case of nomination petitions, if nomination
13  petitions have been filed for printing the name of the same
14  person for the same office, except the office of judge of a
15  court of common pleas, the Philadelphia Municipal Court or the
16  Traffic Court of Philadelphia, or the office of school director
17  in districts where that office is elective or the office of
18  justice of the peace upon the official ballot of more than one
19  political party; or (e) in the case of nomination papers, if the
20  candidate named therein has filed a nomination petition for any
21  public office for the [ensuing] primary election in the year in
22  which the nomination paper is being filed, or has been nominated
23  for any such office by nomination papers previously filed; or
24  (f) if the nomination petitions or papers are not accompanied by
25  the filing fee or certified check required for said office; or
26  (g) in the case of nomination papers, the appellation set forth
27  therein is identical with or deceptively similar to the words
28  used by any existing party or by any political body which has
29  already filed nomination papers for the same office, or if the
30  appellation set forth therein contains part of the name, or an
1  abbreviation of the name or part of the name of an existing
2  political party, or of a political body which has already filed
3  nomination papers for the same office. The invalidity of any
4  sheet of a nomination petition or nomination paper shall not
5  affect the validity of such petition or paper if a sufficient
6  petition or paper remains after eliminating such invalid sheet.
7  The action of said officer or board in refusing to receive and
8  file any such nomination petition, certificate or paper, may be
9  reviewed by the court upon an application to compel its
10  reception as of the date when it was presented to the office of
11  such officer or board: Provided, however, That said officer or
12  board shall be entitled to a reasonable time in which to examine
13  any petitions, certificates or papers, and to summon and
14  interrogate the candidates named therein, or the persons
15  presenting said petitions, certificates or papers, and his or
16  their retention of same for the purpose of making such
17  examination or interrogation shall not be construed as an
18  acceptance or filing.
19     Upon completion of any examination, if any nomination
20  petition, certificate or paper is found to be defective, it
21  shall forthwith be rejected and returned to the candidate or one
22  of the candidates named therein, together with a statement of
23  the reasons for such rejection:
24     Provided further, That no nomination petition, nomination
25  paper or nomination certificate shall be permitted to be filed,
26  if the political party or political body referred to therein
27  shall be composed of a group of electors whose purposes or aims,
28  or one of whose purposes or aims, is the establishment, control,
29  conduct, seizure or overthrow of the Government of the
30  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States of America by
1  the use of force, violence, military measure or threats of one
2  or more of the foregoing. The authority to reject such
3  nomination petition, paper or certificate for this reason shall,
4  when filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth, be vested in
5  a committee composed of the Governor, the Attorney General and
6  the Secretary of the Commonwealth, and when filed with any
7  county board of elections shall be vested in such board. If in
8  such case the committee or board, as the case may be, shall
9  conclude that the acceptance of such nomination petition, paper
10  or certificate should be refused, it shall within two days of
11  the filing of such nomination petition, paper or certificate fix
12  a place and a time five days in advance for hearing the matter,
13  and notice thereof shall be given to all parties affected
14  thereby. At the time and place so fixed the committee or board,
15  as the case may be, shall hear testimony, but shall not be bound
16  by technical rules of evidence. The testimony presented shall be
17  stenographically recorded and made a part of the record of the
18  committee or board. Within two days after such hearing the
19  committee or board, if satisfied upon competent evidence that
20  the said nomination petition, paper or certificate is not
21  entitled to be accepted and filed, it shall announce its
22  decision and immediately notify the parties affected thereby.
23  Failure to announce decision within two days after such hearing
24  shall be conclusive that such nomination petition, paper or
25  certificate has been accepted and filed. The decision of said
26  committee or board in refusing to accept and file such
27  nomination petition, paper or certificate may be reviewed by the
28  court upon an application to compel its reception as of the date
29  when presented to the Secretary of the Commonwealth or such
30  board. The application shall be made within two days of the time
1  when such decision is announced. If the application is properly
2  made, any judge of said court may fix a time and place for
3  hearing the matter in dispute, of which notice shall be served
4  with a copy of said application upon the Secretary of the
5  Commonwealth or the county board of elections, as the case may
6  be. At the time so fixed, the court, or any judge thereof
7  assigned for the purpose, shall hear the case de novo. If after
8  such hearing the said court shall find that the decision of the
9  committee or the board was erroneous, it shall issue its mandate
10  to the committee or board to correct its decision and to accept
11  and file the nomination paper, petition or certificate. From any
12  decision of the court an appeal may be taken [within two days]
13  after the entry thereof. It shall be the duty of the said court
14  to fix the hearing and to announce its decision within such
15  period of time as will permit the Secretary of the Commonwealth
16  or the county board of elections to permit the names of the
17  candidates affected by the court's decision to be printed on the
18  ballot, if the court should so determine.
19     Section 3.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
