15     Section 1.  Section 102 of the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333,
16  No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code, is amended by
17  adding a clause to read:
18     Section 102.  Definitions.--The following words, when used in
19  this act, shall have the following meanings, unless otherwise
20  clearly apparent from the context:
21     * * *
22     (t.1)  The words "recall election" shall mean an election
1  held in conjunction with a regularly scheduled general or
2  municipal election for the purpose of allowing the voters to
3  remove an elected member of a council or legislative body of a
4  county, city, borough, town or township, before the regularly
5  scheduled expiration of his term.
6     * * *
7     Section 2.  The act is amended by adding a section to read:
8     Section 638.  Recall of Members of Councils or Legislative
9  Bodies of Counties, Cities, Boroughs, Towns and Townships.--(a)
10  A member of a council or legislative body of a county, city,
11  borough, town or township is subject to recall from office by
12  the eligible electors entitled to vote for a successor to the
13  incumbent.
14     (b)  Eligible electors of an election district may initiate
15  the recall of an officer of a council or legislative body of a
16  county, city, borough, town or township by signing a petition
17  which demands the removal of the officer to be recalled named in
18  the petition. The petition shall contain a general statement,
19  consisting of two hundred (200) words or less, stating the
20  ground or grounds on which the recall is sought and grounds
21  shall not be open to review.
22     (c)  No recall petition shall be circulated or filed against
23  any officer to be recalled until the officer has actually held
24  office for at least six months. A recall petition shall not be
25  filed during the year in which the officer to be recalled would
26  be eligible for reelection.
27     (d)  The county may charge those filing the recall petition a
28  reasonable administrative fee for the filing and review of the
29  recall petition.
30     (e)  A petition to recall an officer shall be signed by the
1  eligible electors of the election district equal in number to at
2  least thirty per centum of those electors who voted for the
3  officer for which the higher number of votes were cast in the
4  election at which the officer to be recalled was elected. In no
5  case shall the number required for recall be less than ten per
6  centum of eligible electors qualified to vote in the most recent
7  election. Signatures must be obtained within ninety (90) days of
8  the date which the petition was first circulated for signatures.
9  Only an eligible elector may circulate a recall petition or be a
10  signatory of a recall petition. The county election official of
11  the county in which the council or legislative body is located
12  shall then submit the measure at the next general or municipal
13  election held at least ninety (90) days after it qualifies. Upon
14  certification, the county election officials shall notify by
15  registered mail the officer to be recalled.
16     (f)  If a majority of voters voting on the recall election
17  question vote yes for removal, then a replacement shall be named
18  in accordance with this code. If the majority of voters voting
19  on the recall election question vote no for removal, then the
20  officer may serve the remainder of his term.
21     (g)  As used in this section:
22     (1)  The words "eligible elector" shall mean a registered
23  voter who resides in the election district in which the officer
24  to be recalled serves. The "eligible elector" must have voted in
25  the most recent election in which the officer to be recalled was
26  elected.
27     (2)  The words "officer to be recalled" shall mean the
28  elected officer who has served at least six months on a council
29  or legislative body following his election as an officer.
30     Section 3.  If a constitutional amendment authorizing the
1  recall of individuals holding office as elected members of a
2  council or legislative body of a county, city, borough, town or
3  township is ratified, the Secretary of the Commonwealth shall,
4  immediately after tabulating and computing the results of the
5  ratification election, certify the result to the Legislative
6  Reference Bureau for publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin.
7     Section 4.  This act shall take effect as follows:
8         (1)  The amendment or addition of sections 102 and 638 of
9     the act shall take effect upon the publication of the
10     certification under section 3 of this act.
11         (2)  The remainder of this act shall take effect
12     immediately.
