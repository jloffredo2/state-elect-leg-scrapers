9     Section 2.  Sections 1302.2 and 1302.3 of the act, amended
10  December 11, 1968 (P.L.1183, No.375), are amended to read:
11     Section 1302.2.  Approval of Application for Absentee
12  Ballot.--
13     (a) The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
14  application filed by a qualified elector not required to be
15  registered under preceding section 1301, shall ascertain from
16  the information on such application, district register or from
17  any other source that such applicant possesses all the
18  qualifications of a qualified elector other than being
19  registered or enrolled. If the board is satisfied that the
20  applicant is qualified to receive an official absentee ballot,
21  the application shall be marked approved such approval decision
22  shall be final and binding except that challenges may be made
23  only on the ground that the applicant did not possess
24  qualifications of an absentee elector. Such challenges must be
25  made to the county board of elections prior to 5:00 o'clock P.
26  M. on the first Friday prior to the election. When so approved,
27  the county board of elections shall cause the applicant's name
28  and residence (and at a primary, the party enrollment) to be
29  inserted in the Military, Veterans and Emergency Civilians
30  Absentee Voters File as provided in section 1302.3, subsection
1  (b): Providing, however, That no application of any qualified
2  elector in military service shall be rejected for failure to
3  include on his application any information if such information
4  may be ascertained within a reasonable time by the county board
5  of elections.
6     (b) The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
7  application filed by a qualified elector who is entitled, under
8  the provisions of the Permanent Registration Law as now or
9  hereinafter enacted by the General Assembly, to absentee
10  registration prior to or concurrently with the time of voting as
11  provided under preceding section 1301, shall ascertain from the
12  information on such application or from any other source that
13  such applicant possesses all the qualifications of a qualified
14  elector. If the board is satisfied that the applicant is
15  entitled, under the provisions of the Permanent Registration Law
16  as now or hereinafter enacted by the General Assembly, to
17  absentee registration prior to or concurrently with the time of
18  voting and that the applicant is qualified to receive an
19  official absentee ballot, the application shall be marked
20  "approved." Such approval decision shall be final and binding
21  except that challenges may be made only on the ground that the
22  applicant did not possess the qualifications of an absentee
23  elector prior to or concurrently with the time of voting. Such
24  challenges must be made to the county board of elections prior
25  to 5:00 o'clock P. M. on the first Friday prior to the election.
26  When so approved, the county board of elections shall cause the
27  applicant's name and residence (and at a primary, the party
28  enrollment) to be inserted in the Military, Veterans and
29  Emergency Civilian Absentee Voters File as provided in section
30  1302.3 subsection (b).
1     (c) The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
2  application of a qualified elector required to be registered
3  under the provisions of preceding section 1301, shall determine
4  the qualifications of such applicant by comparing the
5  information set forth on such application with the information
6  contained on the applicant's permanent registration card. If the
7  board is satisfied that the applicant is qualified to receive an
8  official absentee ballot, the application shall be marked
9  "approved." Such approval decision shall be final and binding,
10  except that challenges may be made only on the ground that the
11  applicant did not possess the qualifications of an absentee
12  elector. Such challenges must be made to the county board of
13  elections prior to 5:00 o'clock P. M. on the first Friday prior
14  to the election. Challenges to emergency absentee ballot
15  applications received after 5:00 o'clock P. M. on the Friday
16  prior to the primary or election, may be made prior to 5:00
17  o'clock P. M. on the day prior to the primary or election. When
18  [so] an application is approved, the registration commission
19  shall cause an absentee voter's temporary registration card to
20  be inserted in the district register on top of and along with
21  the permanent registration card. If the county board receives an
22  emergency absentee ballot after supplies have been delivered to
23  the election district in accordance with section 1308, it shall
24  prepare a temporary voter's registration card and deliver it
25  with the emergency ballot to the election district. It shall be
26  the responsibility of the judge of elections of that election
27  district to attach the temporary voter's registration card to
28  the elector's permanent registration card. The absentee voter's
29  temporary registration card shall be in the color and form
30  prescribed in subsection (e) of this section:
1     Provided, however, That the duties of the county boards of
2  elections and the registration commissions with respect to the
3  insertion of the absentee voter's temporary registration card of
4  any elector from the district register as set forth in section
5  1302.2 shall include only such applications [and emergency
6  applications] as are received on or before the first Tuesday
7  prior to the primary or election. In all cases where
8  applications are received after the first Tuesday prior to the
9  primary or election and before five o'clock P. M. on the [first
10  Friday] day prior to the primary or election, the county board
11  of elections shall determine the qualifications of such
12  applicant by comparing the information set forth on such
13  application with the information contained on the applicant's
14  duplicate registration card on file in the General Register
15  (also referred to as the Master File) in the office of the
16  Registration Commission and shall cause the name and residence
17  (and at primaries, the party enrollment) to be inserted in the
18  Military, Veterans and Emergency Civilian Absentee Voters File
19  as provided in section 1302.3, subsection (b). In addition, the
20  local district boards of elections shall, upon canvassing the
21  official absentee ballots under section 1308, examine the voting
22  check list of the election district of said elector's residence
23  and satisfy itself that such elector did not cast any ballot
24  other than the one properly issued to him under his absentee
25  ballot application. In all cases where the examination of the
26  local district board of elections discloses that an elector did
27  vote a ballot other than the one properly issued to him under
28  the absentee ballot application, the local district board of
29  elections shall thereupon cancel said absentee ballot and said
30  elector shall be subject to the penalties as hereinafter set
1  forth.
2     (d) In the event that any application for an official
3  absentee ballot is not approved by the county board of
4  elections, the elector shall be notified immediately to that
5  effect with a statement by the county board of the reasons for
6  the disapproval.
7     (e) The absentee voter's temporary registration card shall be
8  in duplicate and the same size as the permanent registration
9  card, in a different and contrasting color to the permanent
10  registration card and shall contain the absentee voter's name
11  and address and shall conspicuously contain the words "Absentee
12  Voter." Such card shall also contain the affidavit required by
13  subsection (b) of section 1306.
14     Section 1302.3.  Absentee Electors Files and Lists.--(a) The
15  county board of elections shall maintain at its office a file
16  containing the duplicate absentee voter's temporary registration
17  cards of every registered elector to whom an absentee ballot has
18  been sent. Such duplicate absentee voter's temporary
19  registration cards shall be filed by election districts and
20  within each election district in exact alphabetical order and
21  indexed. The registration cards so filed shall constitute the
22  Registered Absentee Voters File for the Primary or Election of
23  (date of primary or election) and shall be kept on file for a
24  period commencing the Tuesday prior to the day of the primary or
25  election until the day following the primary or election or the
26  day the county board of elections certifies the returns of the
27  primary or election, whichever date is later. Such file shall be
28  open to public inspection at all times subject to reasonable
29  safeguards, rules and regulations.
30     (b) The county board of elections shall post in a conspicuous
1  public place at its office a master list arranged in
2  alphabetical order by election districts setting forth the name
3  and residence, and at primaries, the party enrollment, of (1)
4  every military elector to whom an absentee ballot is being sent,
5  each such name to be prefixed with an "M"; (2) every bedridden
6  or hospitalized veteran outside the county of his residence who
7  is not registered and to whom an absentee ballot is being sent,
8  each such name to be prefixed with a "V"; and (3) every
9  registered elector who has filed his application for an absentee
10  ballot too late for the extraction of his original registration
11  card and to whom a ballot is being sent and every qualified
12  elector who has filed his application for an absentee ballot and
13  is entitled, under provisions of the Permanent Registration Law
14  as now or hereinafter enacted by the General Assembly, to
15  absentee registration prior to or concurrently with the time of
16  voting, each such name to be prefixed with a "C." This list
17  shall be known as the Military, Veterans and Emergency Civilians
18  Absentee Voters File for the Primary or Election of (date of
19  primary or election) and shall be posted for a period commencing
20  the Tuesday prior to the day of the primary or election until
21  the day following the primary or election or the day on which
22  the county board of elections certifies the returns of the
23  primary or election, whichever date is later. Such file shall be
24  open to public inspection at all times subject to reasonable
25  safeguards, rules and regulations. This posted list shall not
26  contain any military address or references to any military
27  organization. Upon written request, the county board shall
28  furnish a copy of such list to any candidate or party county
29  chairman.
30     (c) [Not less than five] Beginning not less than seven days
1  preceding the election, the chief clerk shall prepare a daily
2  comprehensive list for each election district showing the names
3  and post office addresses of all voting residents thereof to
4  whom official absentee ballots shall have been issued and
5  whether or not a voted absentee ballot has been returned by the
6  voter. Each such list shall be prepared in duplicate, shall be
7  headed "Persons in (give identity of election district) to whom
8  absentee ballots have been issued for the election of (date of
9  election)," and shall be signed by him [not less than four days
10  preceding the election]. He shall post the original of each such
11  list in a conspicuous place in the office of the county election
12  board and see that it is kept so posted until the close of the
13  polls on election day. He shall cause the duplicate final
14  version of each such list to be delivered to the judge of
15  election in the election district [in the same manner and at the
16  same time as are provided in this act for the delivery of other
17  election supplies,] before the opening of the polls and it shall
18  be the duty of such judge of election to post such duplicate
19  list in a conspicuous place within the polling place of his
20  district and see that it is kept so posted throughout the time
21  that the polls are open. Upon written request, he shall furnish
22  a copy of such list to any candidate or party county chairman.

18  sufficiently to permit him to present himself at the proper
19  polling place for the purpose of casting his ballot, such
20  absentee ballot cast by such elector shall, be declared void.
21     Any such elector referred to in this subsection, who is
22  within the municipality of his residence, must present himself

19     Section 1308.  Canvassing of Official Absentee Ballots.--
20     (a)  The county boards of election, upon receipt of official
21  absentee ballots in such envelopes, shall safely keep the same
22  in sealed or locked containers until they distribute same to the
23  appropriate local election districts in a manner prescribed by
24  the Secretary of the Commonwealth.
25     The county board of elections shall then distribute the
26  absentee ballots, unopened, to the absentee voter's respective

8  district. No absentee ballot shall be counted which is received
9  in the office of the county board of election later than five
10  o'clock P. M. on the [Friday] day immediately preceding the
11  primary or November election. Provided, however, that in the
