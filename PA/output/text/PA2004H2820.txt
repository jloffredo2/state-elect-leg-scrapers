24  elections shall mail absentee ballots or special write-in
25  absentee ballots within five days of the county board's receipt

29  the ninety-day period set forth under subsection (a), due to an
30  unresolved objection to a nomination petition or paper filed
1  pursuant to section 977, the withdrawal or death of a candidate
2  for nomination or election, failure of the Secretary of the
3  Commonwealth to transmit a certified list of nominees to the
4  board in accordance with section 984 or any other occurrence
5  outside the control of the board, the county board of elections
6  shall mail or deliver the absentee ballots no later than five
7  days following the resolution of the matter that has caused the
8  noncompliance with the deadline.
