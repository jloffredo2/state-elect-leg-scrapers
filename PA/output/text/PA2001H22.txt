13     Section 3.  Section 2117 of the act, added August 4, 1991
14  (P.L.97, No.22), is amended to read:
15     Section 2117.  Estate Tax.--(a)  In the event that a Federal
16  estate tax is payable to the Federal Government on the transfer
17  of the taxable estate of a decedent who was a resident of this
18  Commonwealth at the time of his death, [and the inheritance tax,
19  if any, actually paid to the Commonwealth by reason of the death
20  of the decedent (disregarding interest or the amount of any
21  discount allowed under section 2142) is less than] a State tax
22  equal to the maximum credit for State death taxes allowable
23  under section 2011 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Public
24  Law 99-514, 26 U.S.C. ยง 2011)[, a tax equal to the difference]
25  is imposed. If a resident decedent owned or had an interest in
26  real property or tangible personal property having a situs in
27  another state, the tax so imposed shall be reduced by the
28  greater of:
29     (1)  the amount of death taxes actually paid to the other
30  state with respect to the estate of the decedent, excluding any
1  death tax expressly imposed to receive the benefit of the credit
2  for state death taxes allowed under section 2011 of the Internal
3  Revenue Code of 1986; or
4     (2)  an amount computed by multiplying the maximum credit for
5  state death taxes allowable under section 2011 of the Internal
6  Revenue code of 1986 by a fraction, the numerator of which is
7  the value of the real property and tangible personal property to
8  the extent included in the decedent's gross estate for Federal
9  estate tax purposes and having a situs in the other state and
10  the denominator of which is the value of the decedent's gross
11  estate for Federal estate tax purposes.
12     (b)  In the event that a Federal estate tax is payable to the
13  Federal Government on the transfer of the taxable estate of a
14  decedent who was not a resident of this Commonwealth at the time
15  of his death but who owned or had an interest in real property
16  or tangible personal property having a situs in this
17  Commonwealth, a tax is imposed in an amount computed by
18  multiplying the maximum credit for State death taxes allowable
19  under section 2011 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by a
20  fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the real
21  property and tangible personal property to the extent included
22  in the decedent's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes
23  having a situs in this Commonwealth and the denominator of which
24  is the value of the decedent's gross estate for Federal estate
25  tax purposes[, and deducting from that amount the inheritance
26  tax, if any, actually paid to the Commonwealth (disregarding
27  interest or the amount of any discount allowed under section
28  2142)].
29     (c)  When an inheritance tax is imposed after an estate tax
30  imposed under subsection (a) or (b) has been paid, the estate
1  tax paid shall be credited against any inheritance tax later
2  imposed.
3     Section 4.  This act shall take effect immediately.
