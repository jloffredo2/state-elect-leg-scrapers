23     Section 1305.  Approval of Application for Absentee Ballot.--
24     (a)  The county board of elections, upon receipt of an
25  application filed by a qualified elector who is entitled to an
26  absentee ballot under section 1301, shall ascertain from the
27  information on the application, district register or from any
28  other source that the applicant possesses all the qualifications
29  of a qualified elector. If the board is satisfied that the
30  applicant is qualified to receive an official absentee ballot,
1  the application shall be marked approved. The approval decision
2  shall be final and binding except that challenges may be made
3  only on the ground that the applicant did not possess
4  qualifications of an absentee elector. Challenges must be made
5  to the county board of elections prior to 5 o'clock P.M. on the
6  first Friday prior to the election. When so approved, the county
7  board of elections shall cause the applicant's name and
8  residence (and at a primary, the party enrollment) to be
9  inserted in the Military, Veterans and Emergency Civilians
10  Absentee Voters File as provided in subsection (b) of section
11  1306. However, no application of any qualified elector in
12  military service shall be rejected for failure to include on the
13  application any information if the information may be
14  ascertained within a reasonable time by the county board of
15  elections.
16     (b)  The duties of the county boards of elections and the
17  registration commissions with respect to the insertion of the
18  absentee voter's temporary registration card of any elector from
19  the district register as set forth in this section shall include
20  only the applications and emergency applications as are received
21  on or before the first Tuesday prior to the election. In all
22  cases where applications are received after the first Tuesday
23  prior to the election and before 5 o'clock P.M. on the first
24  Friday prior to the election, the county board of elections
25  shall determine the qualifications of the applicant by comparing
26  the information set forth on the application with the
27  information contained on the applicant's duplicate registration
28  card on file in the General Register (also referred to as the
29  Master File) in the office of the Registration Commission and
30  shall cause the name and residence (and at primaries, the party
1  enrollment) to be inserted in the Military, Veterans and
2  Emergency Civilian Absentee Voters File as provided in
3  subsection (b) of section 1306. In addition, the local district
4  boards of elections shall, upon canvassing the official absentee
5  ballots under section 1315, examine the voting check list of the
6  election district of the elector's residence and satisfy itself
7  that the elector did not cast any ballot other than the one
8  properly issued under the absentee ballot application. In all
9  cases where the examination of the local district board of
10  elections discloses that an elector did vote a ballot other than
11  the one properly issued under the absentee ballot application,
12  the local district board of elections shall thereupon cancel the
13  absentee ballot and the elector shall be subject to the
14  penalties as set forth under this act.
15     (c)  In the event that any application for an official
16  absentee ballot is not approved by the county board of
17  elections, the elector shall be notified immediately to that
18  effect with a statement by the county board of the reasons for
19  the disapproval. If an application is rejected because it is
20  incomplete, a copy of the original application shall be
21  maintained by the county board.
22     (d)  The absentee voter's temporary registration card shall
23  be in duplicate and the same size as the permanent registration
24  card, in a different and contrasting color to the permanent
25  registration card, and shall contain the absentee voter's name
26  and address and shall conspicuously contain the words "Absentee
27  Voter." The card shall also contain the affidavit required by
28  subsection (a) of section 1313.

30     (a)  The county board of elections shall maintain at its
1  office a file containing the duplicate absentee voter's

15  the official ballots for absentee electors shall be required to
16  indicate on the stub of each ballot so detached the name of the
17  applicant to which that precise ballot is being sent. The county
18  board of elections shall also be required to remove the numbered

20  endorse in red color upon the official ballots the words,
21  Official Absentee Ballot. The ballots shall be distributed by
22  the boards as provided under this act.
23     (b)  In districts in which voting machines are used and in
24  those districts in which paper ballots are used and the county
25  board of elections therein do not print official absentee
26  ballots in accordance with sections 1002 and 1003, the ballots
27  for use by such absentee electors under the provisions of this
28  act shall be prepared sufficiently in advance by the county
29  board of elections and shall be distributed by the boards as
30  provided under this act. Ballots shall be marked Official
1  Absentee Ballot but shall not be numbered and shall otherwise be
2  in substantially the form for ballots required by article ten of
3  this act which form shall be determined and prescribed by the
4  Secretary of the Commonwealth.
5     (c)  In districts in which electronic voting systems are
6  utilized, the absentee ballot may be in the form of a ballot
7  card which shall be clearly stamped on its face "Absentee
8  Ballot."
9     (d)  In cases where there is not time to print on the ballots
10  the names of the various candidates, the county board of
11  elections shall print special write-in absentee ballots which
12  shall be in substantially the form of other official absentee
13  ballots except that the special write-in absentee ballots shall
14  contain blank spaces only under the titles of the offices in
15  which electors may insert the names of the candidates for whom
16  they desire to vote, and in these cases the county board of
17  elections shall furnish to electors lists containing the names
18  of all the candidates named in nomination petitions or who have
19  been regularly nominated under the provisions of this act, for
20  the use of the electors in preparing their ballots. Special
21  write-in absentee ballots also shall include all constitutional
22  amendments and other questions to be voted on by the electors.
23     (e)  The official absentee voter ballot shall state that a
24  voter who receives an absentee ballot pursuant to section 1301
25  and who, on election day, is capable of voting at the
26  appropriate polling place must void the absentee ballot and vote
27  in the normal manner at the appropriate voting place.

28  days of the county board's receipt of the information necessary

14  place because of illness or physical disability, entitled to
15  vote an official absentee ballot shall be in the county of his
16  residence on the day for holding the election for which the
17  ballot was issued, or in the event any elector shall have

20  the purpose of casting his ballot, the absentee ballot cast by
21  the elector shall be declared void.

26  voted had he not received an absentee ballot if the elector has
27  first presented himself to the judge of election in his local
28  election district and shall have signed the affidavit on the
29  absentee voter's temporary registration card, which affidavit
30  shall be in substantially the following form:

6     (a)  Whenever any qualified elector in actual military
7  service is present in the voting district of residence on any
8  primary, special, municipal or general election day and has not
9  already voted in the election, the elector may apply in person

19  elector other than being registered or enrolled. If the board is
20  satisfied that the applicant is qualified to receive an official

5     Section 1315.  Canvassing of Official Absentee Ballots.--
6     (a)  The county boards of elections, upon receipt of official
7  absentee ballots in the envelopes as prescribed, shall safely
8  keep the same in sealed or locked containers. No absentee ballot
9  which is received by the county board of elections later than
10  two o'clock P.M. on the Monday immediately preceding the
11  election may be counted.
12     (b)  No later than four o'clock P.M. on Monday prior to any
13  election the county board of elections shall prepare an
14  alphabetical list containing the names and addresses of all
15  electors who have submitted an absentee ballot in each election
16  district. The list shall be known as the Absentee Ballot Return
17  List. The Absentee Ballot Return List shall be made available
18  for public inspection and copying. Ballots returned by electors
19  defined in subsection (a)(1) of section 1301 and in the
20  emergency provisions contained in subsection (b) of section 1304
21  shall be added to the list as practicable.
22     (c)  The Absentee Ballot Return List shall be distributed to
23  each election district prior to the opening of the polls on
24  election day. The list shall be posted in a conspicuous place in
25  each election district.
26     (d)  The county board of elections may distribute the
27  unopened absentee ballots to the local election district
28  concurrently with the distribution of other election supplies.
29  However, the absentee ballots shall remain in a separate sealed
30  container bearing the following notice printed in boldface type:
1                          ABSENTEE BALLOT
2         The law prohibits the opening of any absentee ballot
3         prior to the closing of the polls. Any challenged ballot
4         shall not be opened but shall be returned to the county
5         board of elections. Any person violating this provision
6         of law shall be guilty of a criminal offense subject to a
7         minimum mandatory fine of two hundred fifty ($250)
8         dollars per ballot.
9     The notice required by this subsection shall be in both
10  English and Spanish where deemed appropriate by the secretary.
11     In no case shall the absentee ballots be distributed later
12  than six o'clock P.M. on election day. The absentee ballot
13  container shall be signed for by the judge of election in the
14  manner prescribed for ballots and other supplies in section
15  1204.
16     (e)  Absentee ballots shall be opened and canvassed in each
17  election district without interruption immediately upon the
18  closing of the polls and prior to the canvassing of other
19  ballots.
20     (f)  Poll watchers, each candidate, each candidate's attorney
21  and each candidate's authorized representative shall be
22  permitted to be present when the envelopes containing official
23  absentee ballots are opened and canvassed. The results of the
24  canvassing of the absentee ballots shall be included in the
25  tally of all votes and returned to the county board of elections
26  with the returns of that district.
27     (g)  (1)  In the event that an electronic voting system
28  provides for central tabulations of ballots, absentee ballots
29  shall be opened and deposited in the ballot box without being
30  counted except as to the number of absentee ballots cast. The
1  absentee ballots shall be counted along with the other ballots
2  from the election district at the location and in the manner
3  specified by the county board of elections and provided for by
4  the electronic voting system utilized.
5     (2)  In the event that an electronic voting system provides
6  for tabulation of votes at the election district, the absentee
7  ballots shall be opened, checked for write-in votes in
8  accordance with section 1113-A and then either hand-counted or
9  counted by means of the automatic tabulation equipment, whatever
10  the case may be.
11     (h)  Whenever it shall appear by due proof that any absentee
12  elector who has returned a ballot in accordance with the
13  provisions of this act has died prior to the opening of the
14  polls on the day of the election, the ballot of the deceased
15  elector shall be rejected by the canvassers but the counting of
16  the ballot of an elector thus deceased shall not of itself
17  invalidate any nomination or election.
18     (i)  The local election board shall then further examine the
19  declaration on each envelope not so set aside and shall compare
20  the information thereon with that contained in the Registered
21  Absentee Voters File, the Absentee Voter Application List, the
22  Absentee Ballot Return List, the absentee voters' list and the
23  Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters File.
24  The local election board shall determine that the declaration is
25  sufficient and shall verify the elector's right to vote.
26     Section 1316.  Absentee Ballot Challenges.--
27     (a)  At any time on election day, a poll watcher, candidate,
28  candidate's attorney or candidate's authorized representative
29  may challenge the ballot of any absentee elector for any of the
30  following reasons:
1     (1)  The absentee elector is not a qualified elector;

3  residence on the day of the election during the period the polls
4  were open, except where he was in military service or was unable
5  to appear personally at the polling place because of illness or
6  physical disability; or
7     (3)  The absentee elector was able to appear personally at
8  the polling place on the day of the election during the period
9  the polls were open and the ballot was obtained for the reason
10  that he was unable to appear personally at the polling place
11  because of illness or physical disability.
12     (b)  Any challenge made pursuant to subsection (a) shall be
13  made to and recorded by the judge of election on the Absentee
14  Ballot Return List together with the reason or reasons therefor.
15  Upon the close of the polls, the judge of election shall unseal
16  the absentee ballot container and mark "Challenged" on the
17  envelope of each challenged ballot with the reason or reasons
18  therefor and the same shall be set aside for return to the
19  county board of elections unopened. Challenged ballots shall not
20  be counted nor included in the tally of votes returned to the
21  county board of elections with the returns of the election
22  district.
23     (c)  The local election board shall announce the names of the
24  electors on all remaining unchallenged ballots and shall give
25  any watcher, candidate, candidate's attorney and candidate's
26  authorized representative present an opportunity to challenge
27  any absentee elector for any of the reasons set forth in
28  subsection (a).
29     (d)  Any person challenging an application for an absentee
30  ballot or an absentee ballot shall deposit the sum of ten ($10)

4  receipt for each challenge made, not to exceed a total of two
5  thousand five hundred ($2,500) dollars for all challenges. All
6  deposits received pursuant to this subsection shall be refunded
7  if the challenge is sustained or if the challenge is withdrawn
8  within five (5) days after the election. If the challenge is
9  dismissed by any lawful order, then the deposit shall be
10  forfeited. All deposit money received by the local election
11  board shall be turned over to the county board of elections
12  simultaneously with the return of the challenged ballots. The
13  county board shall deposit all deposit money in the general fund
14  of the county.
15     (e)  All absentee ballots not challenged for any of the
16  reasons under subsection (a) shall be counted and included with

27     Section 1317.  Impoundment.--
28     (a)  At any time prior to four o'clock P.M. on election day,
29  the candidate or the candidate's attorney may petition the court
30  of common pleas of the county to impound all completed absentee
1  ballots received by the county board of elections from specified
2  districts.
3     (b)  In order to file a petition to impound, a fee of ten
4  ($10) dollars per ballot, with a minimum of one thousand
5  ($1,000) dollars and a maximum of five thousand ($5,000) dollars
6  in cash, as determined by the court, shall be deposited with the
7  court. The fee shall be refunded if the court determines,
8  following review of the absentee ballots by the county board of
9  elections, that the action was not frivolous.
10     (c)  The court shall not be bound by technical rules of
11  evidence, including rules regarding hearsay. The court shall
12  advise all witnesses of the provisions of section 8 of Article
13  VII of the Constitution of Pennsylvania.
14     (d)  If the court determines that the evidence presented
15  indicates a pattern of unlawful absentee voting, the court shall
16  temporarily impound all absentee ballots received by the county
17  board of elections from specified districts pending an order to
18  the county board of elections to conduct a full review of all
19  ballots in accordance with section 1319. The court shall have
20  the discretion to determine if a pattern of unlawful absentee
21  voting exists; however, twenty-five (25) or more illegally cast
22  absentee ballots shall constitute a pattern of unlawful absentee
23  voting for purposes of impoundment.
24     Section 1318.  Canvassing Unchallenged Absentee Ballots.--
25     (a)  The local election board shall open the envelope of
26  every unchallenged absentee elector in a manner as not to
27  destroy the declaration executed thereon. All of the envelopes
28  on which are printed, stamped or endorsed the words "Official
29  Absentee Ballot" shall be placed in one or more depositories at
30  one time and the depository or depositories well shaken and the
1  envelopes mixed before any envelope is taken therefrom.
2     (b)  If any of these envelopes shall contain any extraneous
3  marks or identifying symbols other than the words "Official
4  Absentee Ballot," the envelopes and the ballots contained
5  therein shall be set aside and declared void.
6     (c)  The local election board shall then break the seals of
7  the envelopes, remove the ballots and record the votes in the
8  same manner as district election officers are required to record
9  votes.
10     Section 1319.  County Board of Elections Challenge
11  Procedures.--
12     (a)  The county board of elections shall fix a time and place
13  for a formal hearing of all challenges and notice shall be given
14  where possible to all absentee electors thus challenged and to
15  every watcher, candidate, candidate's attorney or candidate's
16  authorized representative who made a challenge.
17     (b)  The time for the hearing shall be no sooner than two (2)
18  days, but shall not be later than seven (7) days after the date
19  of the challenge. On the day fixed for the hearing, the county
20  board shall proceed without delay to hear challenges.
21     (c)  The county board of elections shall not be bound by
22  technical rules of evidence, including rules regarding hearsay.
23  The county board of elections shall advise all witnesses and
24  participants of the provisions of Article VII, section 8 of the
25  Constitution of Pennsylvania. The board shall hear witnesses
26  presented for each individual challenged ballot and evidence of
27  fraud or illegal activity, whether discovered before or after
28  the election.
29     (d)  The testimony presented shall be stenographically
30  recorded and made part of the record of the hearing.
1     (e)  The decision of the county board of elections in
2  upholding or dismissing any challenge shall be in writing and
3  may be reviewed by the court of common pleas of the county upon
4  a petition filed by any person aggrieved by the decision of the
5  county board. The appeal must be taken to the court of common
6  pleas no later than two (2) business days after the decision of
7  the board, with the petition setting forth the objections to the
8  county board's decision.
9     (f)  No certification of the results of the election by the
10  county board may occur during the two-day appeal period. If an
11  appeal is taken, no certification of the results of the
12  challenged election may occur until the resolution of all
13  appeals or six (6) months from the date of the election,
14  whichever is sooner. However, a court having jurisdiction over
15  an appeal of the decision of the county board may order the
16  certification of the election if it determines that the fraud or
17  other improper conduct or procedure alleged could not have
18  altered the outcome of the election. Following such
19  certification, the appeal may continue as to the fraud or other
20  improper conduct or procedure.
21     (g)  Upon the resolution of all appeals or six (6) months
22  from the date of the election, the county board of elections
23  shall complete the computation of the returns for the challenged
24  election. The votes cast upon the challenged official absentee
25  ballots which are upheld shall be added to the other votes cast
26  within the county.
27     (h)  In hearing an appeal under this article, the court shall
28  not be bound by the technical rules of evidence, including rules
29  regarding hearsay. The court shall advise all witnesses of the
30  provisions of section 8 of Article VII of the Constitution of
1  Pennsylvania. The court shall admit evidence of fraud or illegal
2  activity, whether discovered before or after the election.
3     (i)  The courts of the Commonwealth shall expedite all
4  appeals which come before them under this article.
5     Section 1320.  Public Records.--All official absentee
6  ballots, files, applications for absentee ballots and envelopes
7  on which the executed declarations appear, and all information
8  and lists are hereby designated and declared to be public
9  records. All such public records shall be maintained for a
10  period of five (5) years. No candidate or other elector shall be
11  denied access to any public record within the meaning of this
12  section. No information concerning a military elector shall be
13  made public which is expressly forbidden by the Department of
14  Defense.
15     Section 3.  Section 1404(f) of the act is amended and the
16  section is amended by adding a subsection to read:
17     Section 1404.  Computation of Returns by County Board;
18  Certification; Issuance of Certificates of Election.--
19     * * *
20     (f)  As the returns from each election district are read,
21  computed and found to be correct or corrected as aforesaid, they
22  shall be recorded on the blanks prepared for the purpose until
23  all the returns from the various election districts which are
24  entitled to be counted shall have been duly recorded, when they
25  shall be added together, announced and attested by the clerks
26  who made and computed the entries respectively and signed by the
27  members of the county board. At the expiration of five days
28  after the completion of the computation of votes, in case no
29  petition for a recount or recanvass has been filed in accordance
30  with the provisions of this act, [or upon the completion of the
1  recount or recanvass if a petition therefor has been filed
2  within five days after the completion of the computation of
3  votes,] the county board shall certify the returns so computed
4  in said county in the manner required by this act, unless upon
5  appeals taken from any decision, the court of common pleas shall
6  have directed any returns to be revised, or unless in case of a
7  recount, errors in the said returns shall have been found, in
8  which case said returns shall be revised, corrected and
9  certified accordingly. The county board shall thereupon, in the
10  case of elections, issue certificates of election to the
11  successful candidates for all county, city, borough, township,
12  ward, school district, poor district and election offices, and
13  local party offices to be filled by the votes of the electors of
14  said county, or of any part thereof.
15     (g)  In the event of any recount, recanvass or other
16  challenge based on fraud or any other violation of this act, the
17  board shall not certify the election for a period of two (2)
18  business days following its determination or ruling on the
19  matter. A decision of the county board of elections may be taken
20  to the court of common pleas of the county within two (2)
21  business days after the decision of the board. If an appeal is
22  taken, no certification of the results of the challenged
23  election may occur until the resolution of all appeals or until
24  the expiration of six (6) months from the date of the election,
25  whichever is sooner. The courts of this Commonwealth shall
26  expedite all appeals and other matters which come before them
27  pursuant to this act.
28     Section 4.  Section 1407 of the act, repealed in part April
29  28, 1978 (P.L.202, No.53), is amended to read:
30     Section 1407.  Appeals to Court from Decisions of the County
1  Board.--
2     (a)  Any person aggrieved by any order or decision of any
3  county board regarding the computation or canvassing of the
4  returns of any primary or election, or regarding any recount or
5  recanvass thereof under sections 1701, 1702 and 1703 of this
6  act, may appeal therefrom within two days after such order or
7  decision shall have been made, whether then reduced to writing
8  or not, to the court of common pleas of the proper county,
9  setting forth why he feels that an injustice has been done, and
10  praying for such order as will give him relief. Upon the payment
11  to the prothonotary of a fee for filing such appeal, a judge of
12  the court shall fix a time and place for hearing the matter in
13  dispute within three days thereafter, of which due notice shall
14  be served, with a copy of such appeal, by the appellant upon a
15  member of the county board whose action is complained of and
16  upon every attorney, watcher or candidate who opposed the
17  contention of the appellant before the county board, and upon
18  any other person that the judge shall direct, at least two days
19  before the matter shall be reviewed by the court. Proof of such
20  notice or the waiver thereof must be filed therein before any
21  appeal is sustained.
22     (b)  [The] A court [on an] hearing any action or appeal
23  regarding any election shall have full and broad power and
24  authority to hear and determine all matters pertaining to any
25  fraud [or], error or other act which violates the election laws
26  of this Commonwealth committed in any election district [to
27  which such appeal relates,] and to make such order or decree [as
28  right and justice may require] to create a fair and just
29  resolution. An order under this subsection may include, but
30  shall not be limited to, a recount, the voiding of improperly
1  cast ballots, an award of damages or a new election. Pending
2  [such] an appeal[, the] of the decision of a county board, the
3  board shall suspend any official certification of the votes cast
4  in such election district, in accordance with section 1319(f)
5  and (g). None of the orders or decisions of either the county
6  board or [the] any court [of common pleas] on appeal shall be
7  deemed a final adjudication regarding the results of any
8  [primary or] election, so as to preclude any contest thereof.
9  [No appeal shall be allowed or granted from any order or decree
10  of the court of common pleas made in pursuance of this section.]
11  The court of common pleas, upon any appeal under this section,
12  may compel the appellant or any opposing party, other than the
13  county board, to pay all the witness fees, if any, or other
14  legal costs of the hearing, which costs may be taxed by the
15  prothonotary in the usual manner.
16     Section 5.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
