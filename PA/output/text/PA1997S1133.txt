6     (2)  if the county board of elections determines that all
7  potential polling places have been surveyed and an accessible
8  place is not available and the county is not able to make one
9  temporarily accessible in the area involved and the county board
10  of elections assures that a voter with a disability or an
11  elderly voter assigned to an inaccessible polling place, upon
12  advance request of such voter, will be assigned to an accessible
13  polling place or will be provided with alternative means of
