10     Section 1.  Section 775 of the act of March 10, 1949 (P.L.30,
11  No.14), known as the Public School Code of 1949, amended October
12  7, 1955 (P.L.676, No.187) and October 21, 1965 (P.L.601,
13  No.312), is amended to read:
14     Section 775.  Use of School Buildings for Other Purposes;
15  Arrangements with City, Borough or Township.--The board of
16  school directors of any district may permit the use of its
17  school grounds and buildings for social, recreation, and other
18  proper purposes, under such rules and regulations as the board
19  may adopt. The board shall make such arrangements with any city,
20  borough, or township authorities for the improvement, care,
1  protection, and maintenance of school buildings and grounds for
2  school, park, play, or other recreation purposes, as it may see
3  proper. Any board of school directors may make such arrangements
4  as it may see proper with any officials or individuals for the
5  temporary use of school property for schools, playgrounds,
6  social, recreation, or other proper educational purposes,
7  [primaries and elections,] and may permit the use of any school
8  building for holding official meetings of the governing
9  authorities of corporate or politic, governmental or quasi-
10  governmental bodies, created by authority of any act of
11  Assembly. The use thereof shall not interfere with school
12  programs and shall be subject to reasonable rules and
13  regulations adopted by the board of school directors.
14     Upon request of a county board of elections made under
15  section 527 of the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known
16  as the "Pennsylvania Election Code," the board of school
17  directors shall make arrangements for the use of school property
18  as a polling place. Rules and regulations adopted by a board of
19  school directors that prohibit use of school property as a
20  polling place or that impose unreasonable conditions on use of
21  school property as a polling place shall be null and void.
22     Funds raised by individuals, groups, associations, or
23  corporations, through the permissive use of school grounds or
24  buildings, now or hereafter authorized by law, shall be the
25  property of the individuals, groups, associations, or
26  corporations, and not the property of the school district,
27  subject, however, to such arrangements as the board may, at its
28  discretion, lawfully make.
29     The board of school directors of any school district shall
30  have power and authority to lease any part of their respective
1  school building, equipment and premises, or any vacant building,
2  for any educational purpose. Such leases shall be subject to the
3  terms and regulations which may be adopted by the board of
4  school directors, and except in districts of the first class,
5  shall be further subject to the approval of the Department of
6  Public Instruction.
7     The board of public education or the board of school
8  directors of any school district shall have power and authority
9  to lease any of their respective school buildings or athletic
10  fields to any reputable organization or group of persons for
11  charitable purposes, subject to such charges as the board shall
12  consider proper to reimburse it for any costs resulting from the
13  leasing of such school buildings or athletic fields. At the time
14  of such leasing, any such board may require a bond, in an amount
15  that it may deem proper, with responsible sureties or
16  securities, and a statement of the charitable purposes for which
17  such lease is requested.
18     Section 2.  Section 1502 of the act, amended May 6, 1996
19  (P.L.150, No.28), is amended to read:
20     Section 1502.  Days Schools not to be Kept Open.--(a)  Except
21  as provided in subsection (c), no school shall be kept open on
22  any Saturday for the purpose of ordinary instruction, except
23  when Monday is fixed by the board of school directors as the
24  weekly holiday, or on Sunday, primary election day, Memorial
25  Day, Fourth of July, general election day or Christmas nor shall
26  any school be kept open in any district during the time of
27  holding the teachers' institute for such district.
28     (c)  For the school year 1995-1996 only, the board of school
29  directors shall have the option of rescheduling instructional
30  days on Saturday, but for not more than one Saturday per month,
1  to make up instructional days lost from the adopted school
2  calendar because school was closed as a result of the weather
3  emergency of 1996. In those cases where a board of directors
4  chooses to reschedule instructional days on Saturdays in
5  accordance with the provisions of this section, schools within
6  such board's jurisdiction shall not schedule tests or
7  examinations on these Saturdays. Notwithstanding the provisions
8  of subsection (a), if the board of school directors reschedules
9  an instructional day on Saturday, the schools may be open the
10  following Monday.
11     Section 3.  All acts and parts of acts are repealed insofar
12  as they are inconsistent with this act.
13     Section 4.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
