6  investigation which may include investigation of reports and
7  statements made or failed to be made by the complainant and any

28  the county board to conduct an investigation, the county board
29  shall report their findings to the State board who may refer the
30  matter in accordance with this subsection.

24     (1)  The payment, distribution, loan or advancement of money
25  or any valuable thing by a candidate, political committee or
26  other person for the purpose of influencing the outcome of an
27  election; Provided, however, That such payment, distribution,
28  loan or advancement of money or any valuable thing must be made
29  only for legitimate and verifiable campaign expenses and not for

2  money or other valuable thing between or among political
3  committees;

30  suggestion of any candidate or political committee or agent
1  thereof.]
2     The words "independent expenditure" shall mean an expenditure

12  oral or written authority, either express or implied, to make or
13  to authorize the making of expenditures on behalf of a
14  candidate, or shall mean any person who has been placed in a
15  position within the campaign organization where it would

29  to advocate the election or defeat of one or more clearly
30  identified candidates;
1     (ii)  referring to one or more clearly identified candidates
2  in a paid advertisement that is transmitted through radio or
3  television within 60 calendar days preceding the date of an
4  election of the candidate; or
5     (iii)  expressing unmistakable and unambiguous support for or
6  opposition to one or more clearly identified candidates when
7  taken as a whole and with limited reference to external events
8  such as the proximity to an election.
9  The word "expressly advocating" does not include the publication
10  or distribution of a communication that:
11     (A)  Presents information in an educational manner solely
12  about the voting record or position on a campaign issue of two
13  (2) or more candidates.
14     (B)  Is not made in coordination with a candidate, political
15  party or agent of the candidate or party, or a candidate's agent
16  or a person who is coordinating with a candidate or a

19  "support," "vote against," "defeat," or "reject" or other slogan
20  or words along with the name or picture of the candidate that in
21  context can have no reasonable meaning other than to urge the

8  of elections for filing a report required by section 1626(e)

10  political committee designating it a termination report or
11  statement. No candidate or political committee may terminate
12  unless such candidate or committee has a zero balance. No
13  candidate or committee may terminate by way of a statement. In
14  the case of quarterly reports, said report shall cover the
15  campaign activity of a candidate or political committee from the
16  last prior report or statement. Once terminated, a political
17  committee must comply with sections 1623 and 1624 before

17  to receive contributions or make expenditures for the candidate
18  who has so declared shall abide by the provisions of section
19  1612-A. Any candidate who for any reason has his name withdrawn

27  hundred dollars ($100) in the aggregate shall be deemed only a
