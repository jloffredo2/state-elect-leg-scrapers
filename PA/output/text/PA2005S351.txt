19     (a)  Development and implementation.--
20         (1)  The department shall develop and implement uniform
21     voting procedures that shall be used at all elections held in
22     this Commonwealth. In developing and implementing uniform
23     voting procedures, the department may use any available
24     research and reports issued by Federal or State agencies
25     relevant to developing and implementing uniform voting
26     procedures.
27         (2)  Prior to implementing uniform voting procedures, the
28     department shall receive input from counties, including
29     comments and recommendations from members of county boards
30     and district election boards.
1     (b)  Criteria for uniform voting procedures.--In developing
2  and implementing uniform voting procedures, the department shall
3  use, but is not limited to, the following criteria:
4         (1)  The procedures shall be easy for qualified electors
5     to understand and use. In order to assist the district
6     election board in confirming a qualified elector's
7     registration and in resolving registration problems, the
8     procedures may include the use by qualified electors of an
9     identification card that may be read at the polling place by
10     a computer linking the district election board directly to
11     the county board.
12         (2)  The procedures shall protect the privacy of
13     qualified electors and the security of their voters and shall
14     prevent voter fraud.
15         (3)  The procedures shall provide prompt and accurate
16     election results from the district election board to the
17     county board, media and public. The procedures may include a
18     computer network that directly links the district election
19     board at the polling place to the county board for prompt and
20     secure transmission of election results.
21         (4)  The procedures shall be standardized for use at all
22     elections held in this Commonwealth. The procedures may not
23     include punch cards and other voting methods that could
24     potentially result in incorrect voting such as double voting.
25         (5)  The procedures shall use technological advances
26     including systems that utilize touch-screen computers and the
27     Internet.
28  Section 4.  Repeals.
29     All acts and parts of acts are repealed insofar as they are
30  inconsistent with the provisions of this act.
1  Section 5.  Applicability.

3  shall be implemented and applied to all elections held in this
4  Commonwealth on or after January 1, 2007.
