19  a nomination petition shall sign but one such petition for each
20  office to be filled, and shall declare therein that he is a
21  registered and enrolled member of the party designated in such
22  petition: Provided, however, That where there are to be elected
1  two or more persons to the same office, each signer may sign
2  petitions for as many candidates for such office as, and no more
3  than, he could vote for at the succeeding election. He shall
4  also declare therein that he is a qualified elector of the
5  county therein named, and in case the nomination is not to be
6  made or candidates are not to be elected by the electors of the
7  State at large, of the political district therein named, in
8  which the nomination is to be made or the election is to be
9  held. He shall add his residence, giving city, borough or
10  township, with street and number, if any, and shall legibly
11  print his name and add the date of signing, expressed in words
12  or numbers: Provided, however, That if the said political
13  district named in the petition lies wholly within any city,
14  borough or township, or is coextensive with same, it shall not
15  be necessary for any signer of a nomination petition to state
16  therein the city, borough or township of his residence. The
17  county board shall make nomination petitions available upon
18  request of the candidate beginning on the fifteenth Tuesday
19  prior to the primary. No nomination petition shall be circulated
20  for signature prior to the thirteenth Tuesday before the
21  primary, and no signature shall be counted unless it bears a
22  date affixed not earlier than the thirteenth Tuesday nor later
23  than the tenth Tuesday prior to the primary.
24     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
