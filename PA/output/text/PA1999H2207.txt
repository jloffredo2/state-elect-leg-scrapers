15  days of receiving notice of the death of an individual 18 years
16  of age or older, send the] report to the registration commission
1  within 30 days of the last day of each calendar month the deaths

10  cancellations made pursuant to the reports of the Department of
11  Health for the previous month. An individual incorrectly
12  reported deceased by the Department of Health may appear in
13  person before a commissioner, registrar or clerk at the office
14  of the commission and prove identity. The commission, upon such
15  proof, shall correct its records. Failure to cancel the
