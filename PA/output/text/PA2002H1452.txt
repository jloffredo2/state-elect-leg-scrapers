18     * * *
19     (b)  All watchers so appointed shall serve in only one
20  district and must be qualified registered electors of the
21  [municipality or township] county in which the district where
1  they are authorized to act is located. It shall not be a
2  requirement that they be residents of the district where they
3  are authorized to act. Only one watcher for each candidate at
4  primaries, or for each party or political body at general,
5  municipal or special elections, shall be allowed to remain in
6  the polling place at any one time prior to the close of the
7  polls, and all watchers in the room shall remain outside the
8  enclosed space. After the close of the polls and while the
9  ballots are being counted or voting machine canvassed, all the
10  watchers shall be permitted to be in the polling place outside
11  the enclosed space. Each watcher shall be provided with a
12  certificate from the county board of elections, stating his name
13  and the name of the candidate, party or political body he
14  represents. Watchers shall be required to show their
15  certificates when requested to do so. Watchers allowed in the
16  polling place under the provisions of this act, shall be
17  permitted to keep a list of voters and shall be entitled to
18  challenge any person making application to vote and to require
19  proof of his qualifications, as provided by this act. [All
20  watchers so appointed as set forth above, who are to serve in a
21  district other than the one from which they are registered
22  electors, are to be appointed on petition to the court of common
23  pleas. Said petition shall set forth that the watcher is a
24  qualified voter of the municipality or township in which the
25  district is located and that said watcher is a law abiding
26  citizen and of good repute, and the court shall consider all
27  factors relevant to said petition before granting or refusing
28  same.]
