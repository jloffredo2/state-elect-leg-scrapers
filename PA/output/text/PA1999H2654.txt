14  of the polls. Prior to the commencement of the election, the
15  district election board shall inspect the district components of
16  the Internet voting system to see that they are in proper
17  working order and shall break the seal of the operating system
18  and insert it into the Internet voting machine and start the

20     (3)  A qualified elector who wishes to utilize the Internet
21  voting machine procedure shall be permitted to vote at any
22  polling place within the elector's county of residence.
23     (4)  A qualified elector, after receiving his PIN from
24  district election officials, shall retire to one of the voting
25  booths in which the Internet voting machines are located.
26     (5)  The elector shall visit the Internet balloting web page
27  for his county and authenticate himself to that server by
28  entering his PIN and any personal information required for
29  authentication and request a ballot.
30     (6)  The server shall send an image of the appropriate ballot
1  back to the elector.
2     (7)  The elector shall mark the ballot with the keyboard,
3  mouse or touch screen if the machine is so equipped.
4     (8)  When the elector is finished making his choices, he
5  shall click a button on the screen to send the ballot. A screen
6  will then be displayed that shows all of the elector's choices
7  for verification. When the elector confirms the selections, the
8  ballot is encrypted and sent to the central vote server. If the
9  elector does not confirm the selections, the ballot is reset and
10  he has the option of remarking the ballot.
11     (9)  When the vote server receives the ballot, it will verify
12  that it has been sent from a qualified elector who has not yet
13  voted and has not been altered in any form during transmission.
14     (10)  Once the vote has been verified, the server will send
15  feedback to the voter acknowledging that the vote has been
16  accepted.
17     (11)  The server then separates the vote from the
18  identification of the elector and stores the vote for counting.
19     (12)  After the polls close for the day, the county elections
20  officials, one being from each party, shall enter their separate
21  decryption keys so that the ballots can be decrypted and
22  canvassed.

24  election officer or other person who shall unlawfully tamper
25  with or injure or attempt to injure any component of an Internet
26  voting system to be used at any primary or election, or who
27  shall prevent or attempt to prevent the correct operation and
28  communication of such a system, or any unauthorized person who
29  shall make or have in his possession a decryption key to an
30  Internet voting system to be used or being used in any primary
1  or election, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon
2  conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine not
3  exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000), or to undergo an
4  imprisonment of not less than seven years not more than ten
5  years, or both, at the discretion of the court.
6     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
