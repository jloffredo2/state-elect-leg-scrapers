15     Section 1.  Section 1002 of the act of June 3, 1937
16  (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code, is
17  amended by adding a subsection to read:
18     Section 1002.  Form of Official Primary Ballot.--* * *
19     (e)  At primaries separate official ballots shall be prepared
20  for use by qualified electors enrolled as independents which
21  ballots shall list the name of any candidate who has cross-filed
22  nomination petitions and whose name is to be printed on the
1  official primary ballot of more than one party. The candidate's
2  name shall be printed once and the names of each political party
3  for which the person has consented to be a candidate shall be
4  printed opposite the name of the candidate, arranged in the same
5  order as candidates' names are required to be arranged under
6  section 1003(b) of this act. At the right of each party name
7  shall be a single square of sufficient size for the convenient
8  insertion of a cross (X) or check ( ) mark. The separate
9  official ballots for use by qualified electors enrolled as
10  independents shall be in substantially the following form:
11       Official.......................Independent Primary Ballot.
12  ........District,........Ward, City of.......................,
13  County of............................, State of Pennsylvania
14  ........Primary election held on the.....day of........., 19...
15     Make a cross (X) or check ( ) in the square to the right of
16  one of the party names opposite each candidate for whom you wish
17  to vote. Mark ballot only in black lead pencil, indelible pencil
18  or blue, black or blue-black ink in fountain pen or ball point
19  pen. Use the same pencil or pen for all markings you place on
20  the ballot.
21     On the back of each ballot for use by qualified electors
22  enrolled as independents shall be printed in prominent type the
23  words "OFFICIAL PRIMARY BALLOT OF INDEPENDENT ELECTORS FOR"
24  followed by the designation of the election district for which
25  it is prepared, the date of the primary and the facsimile
26  signatures of the members of the county board of elections. The
27  names of candidates shall in all cases be arranged under the
28  title of the office for which they are candidates, and be
29  printed thereunder in the order determined by the casting of
30  lots as provided by this act. Under the title of such offices
1  where more than one candidate is to be voted for, shall be
2  printed "Vote for not more than ........" (the blank space to
3  indicate the number of candidates to be voted for the particular
4  office.) At the right of the name of each candidate there shall
5  be a square of sufficient size for the convenient insertion of a
6  cross (x) or check ( ) mark. Opposite or under the name of each
7  candidate, who is to be voted for by the electors of more than
8  one county, shall be printed the name of the county in which
9  such candidate resides; and opposite or under the name of each
10  candidate shall be printed the name of the city, borough,
11  township or ward, as the case may be, in which such candidate
12  resides.
13     Section 2.  Sections 1107(f) and 1111(a) of the act are
14  amended to read:
15     Section 1107.  Requirements of Voting Machines.--No voting
16  machine shall, upon any examination or reexamination, be
17  approved by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, or by any
18  examiner appointed by him, unless it shall, at the time, satisfy
19  the following requirements:
20     * * *
21     (f) It shall be capable of adjustment by election officers,
22  so as to permit each voter at a primary election to vote only
23  for the candidates for nonpartisan nomination, if any, and for
24  the candidates seeking nomination by the political party in
25  which he is registered and enrolled, if he is enrolled as a
26  member of a political party, and so as to preclude him from
27  voting for the candidates seeking nomination by any political
28  party in which he is not enrolled and in the case of voters
29  enrolled as independent, for candidates who have cross-filed
30  nomination petitions and whose names are on the official primary
1  ballot of more than one party, if any.
2     * * *
3     Section 1111.  Preparation of Voting Machines by County
4  Election Boards.--
5     (a) The county election board of each county shall cause the
6  proper ballot labels to be placed on each voting machine which
7  is to be used in any election district within such county; and
8  shall cause each machine to be placed in proper order for
9  voting; shall examine each machine before it is sent out to a
10  polling place; shall see that each registering counter, except
11  the protective counter, on each machine is set at zero (000);
12  shall lock each machine so that the counting machinery cannot be
13  operated, and shall seal each machine with a numbered seal. The
14  county election board or their duly authorized agent shall
15  adjust each machine to be used at a primary election, so that
16  the election officers may lock it on primary election day, in
17  such a way that each voter can vote only for the candidates for
18  nonpartisan nomination, if any, and for the candidates seeking
19  nomination by the political party in which he is enrolled, if he
20  is enrolled as a member of a political party, and so that no
21  voter can vote for the candidates seeking nomination by any
22  political party in which he is not enrolled and, in the case of
23  voters enrolled as independent, for candidates who have cross-
24  filed nomination petitions and whose names are on the official
25  primary ballot of more than one party, if any.
26     * * *

29     Section 1107-A.  Requirements of Electronic Voting Systems.--
30  No electronic voting system shall, upon any examination or

10  which he is entitled to vote and, in the case of voters enrolled
11  as independent, for any candidate who has cross-filed nomination
12  petitions and whose name is on the official primary ballot of
13  more than one party.
14     * * *
15     Section 1112-A.  Election Day Procedures and the Process of
16  Voting.--(a)  In an election district which uses an electronic
17  voting system in which votes are registered electronically, the
18  following procedures will be applicable for the conduct of the
19  election at the election district:
20     (1)  At primary elections, the election officer in charge
21  shall adjust the voting system before the voter records any vote
22  so that the voter will only be able to register a vote for
23  candidates on the ballot of the party in which he is registered
24  and enrolled or for persons whose names are not on the official
25  ballot, for candidates for nonpartisan nominations, if any,
26  [and] for any questions upon which he is entitled to vote and,

4     * * *

9  and for candidates for nonpartisan nomination, if any, and, in
10  the case of voters enrolled as independent, for candidates who
11  have cross-filed nomination petitions and whose names are on the
12  official primary ballot of more than one party, if any.

14     Section 5.  (a)  Section 9 of the act of July 25, 1913
