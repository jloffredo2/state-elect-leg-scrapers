26         (3)  An individual shall not be considered to have gained

30     of abode.
1         (4)  If an individual removes to another state with the

5         (5)  If an individual removes to another state with the

10     (a)  General rule.--Applications may be submitted to register
11  to vote or change party enrollment or name or address on a
12  current registration record in person before the commission or a
13  commissioner, a registrar or a clerk at the office of the
14  commission or at a place designated by the commission. The
15  applicant shall be advised that any intentional false statement
16  on the application constitutes perjury and will be punishable as
17  such. The applicant shall provide the information required on
18  the registration application and sign the registration
19  declaration. The commission shall prepare and provide voter
20  registration applications for the purpose of registering
21  qualified electors in accordance with this section.
22  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the commission
23  may use a mail registration application for in-person
24  registration. The commission shall mail the qualified elector an
25  identification card in accordance with section 1328 (relating to
26  approval of registration applications).
27     (b)  Notice.--The commission shall, within a reasonable time,
28  publicly announce the address of each place of registration, the
29  address of each office of the commission established for the
30  registration of qualified electors other than its main office
1  and the days and hours when the place or office is open for the
2  registration of qualified electors. The announcement shall be
3  made by posting notice at the place or office and at the
4  commission's main office and by other means as the commission
5  deems advisable.
6     (c)  Polls.--The election board of each county shall cause
7  any polling place to be open, in proper order for use, as a
8  place of registration on each day when the polling place is
9  desired by the commission or required by the provisions of this
10  part for use as a place of registration. The appropriating
11  authority of the county shall provide for the payment of rentals
12  for such polling places and other places of registration.
13     (d)  Schools.--The board of public education or the board of
14  school directors shall furnish suitable space in any public
15  school building under its jurisdiction or control and shall
16  cause the space to be open and in proper order for use as a
17  place of registration on each day when the space is desired by
18  the commission for use as a place of registration in accordance
19  with the provisions of this part. Use under this subsection may
20  not interfere with school instruction.
21     (e)  Municipal buildings.--The proper authority in the county
22  or municipality shall furnish suitable space in a building under
23  its jurisdiction or control and shall cause the space to be open
24  and in proper order for use as a place of registration on each
25  day when the space is desired by the commission for use as a
26  place of registration. Use under this subsection may not
27  interfere with the use for which the space is primarily
28  designed.
29  § 1323.  Application with driver's license application.
30     (a)  General rule.--
1         (1)  The Department of Transportation shall provide for
2     simultaneous application for voter registration in
3     conjunction with the process under 75 Pa.C.S. § 1510
4     (relating to issuance and content of driver's license). An
5     application under this subsection shall serve as an
6     application to register to vote unless the applicant fails to
7     sign the voter registration application. The secretary has
8     the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the
9     driver's license voter registration system created under this
10     section. The secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of
11     Transportation, may promulgate regulations for implementing
12     this section.
13         (2)  An application for voter registration submitted to
14     the Department of Transportation under this subsection shall
15     be considered as updating any previous voter registration
16     information by a registrant.
17         (3)  Any change of address submitted to the Department of
18     Transportation for the purposes of driver licensing shall
19     serve as notification of change of address for voter
20     registration for the registrant involved unless the
21     registrant indicates that the change of address is not for
22     voter registration purposes.
23     (b)  Process.--
24         (1)  The Department of Transportation shall provide for
25     an application for voter registration as part of a driver's
26     license application.
27         (2)  The format of the driver's license/voter
28     registration application shall be determined and prescribed
29     by the secretary and the Secretary of Transportation.
30         (3)  The voter registration application portion of the
1     application shall contain all the requirements of an official
2     voter registration application specified in section 1327
3     (relating to preparation and distribution of applications).
4     The voter registration portion of the application:
5             (i)  may not require any information that duplicates
6         information required in the driver's license portion of
7         the form, other than a second signature; and
8             (ii)  may require only the minimum amount of
9         information necessary to prevent duplicate voter
10         registration, to enable the commission to assess the
11         eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter
12         registration and other parts of the election process.
13     (c)  Transmission.--
14         (1)  The Department of Transportation shall forward
15     completed applications or contents of the completed voter
16     registration applications in machine-readable format to the
17     department by the close of registration for the ensuing
18     election.
19         (2)  The department shall transmit the material to the
20     appropriate commission within ten days after the date of its
21     receipt by the Department of Transportation. If a voter
22     registration application is received by the Department of
23     Transportation within five days before the last day to
24     register before an election, the application shall be
25     transmitted to the appropriate commission not later than five
26     days after the date of its receipt by the Department of
27     Transportation.
28         (3)  Upon receipt of the completed voter registration
29     information from the department, the commission shall make a
30     record of the date of the receipt of the application and
1     process the application. No applicant shall be deemed
2     eligible to vote until the commission has received and
3     approved the application.
4         (3.1)  After the Department of Transportation is
5     connected to the SURE system and notwithstanding paragraphs
6     (1), (2) and (3), the Department of Transportation shall
7     transmit electronically the contents of a completed voter
8     registration application within five days of receipt of the
9     application. Upon receipt of the information from the
10     Department of Transportation, a commission shall make a
11     record of the date of the receipt of the application and
12     process the application in accordance with section 1328
13     (relating to approval of registration applications). If the
14     commission of the county of residence has not been connected
15     to the SURE system, the Department of Transportation shall
16     forward the completed application or contents of the
17     completed application to the department in accordance with
18     paragraph (1). No applicant shall be deemed eligible to vote
19     until the commission has received and approved an application
20     in accordance with section 1328.
21         (4)  Changes of address shall comply with the following:
22             (i)  Before the Department of Transportation is
23         connected to the SURE system, the Department of
24         Transportation shall notify the department of changes of
25         address received under subsection (a)(3). The department
26         shall notify the commission of the county of the
27         registrant's former residence. After the Department of
28         Transportation is connected to the SURE system, the
29         Department of Transportation shall notify the commission
30         of the county of the registrant's former residence. If
1         the registrant has moved to an address outside this
2         Commonwealth, the commission shall verify the address
3         change in accordance with section 1901 (relating to
4         removal of electors). Except as provided in subparagraph
5         (ii), if the registrant confirms in accordance with
6         section 1901(d) that he has moved to another county, the
7         commission shall cancel the registration and forward the
8         registrant's registration information to the commission
9         of the registrant's new county of residence. Except as
10         provided in subparagraph (ii), if the registrant has
11         moved to an address within the commission's jurisdiction,
12         the commission shall promptly update the registration
13         record of the registrant in accordance with section 1328.
14         All changes of address received by the Department of
15         Transportation under this section at least 30 days before
16         an election must be processed by the commission for the
17         ensuing election. For the purpose of this paragraph, the
18         term "registration information" means the registration
19         card and any other record of registration maintained by a
20         commission.
21             (ii)  In the case of changes of address received by
22         the Department of Transportation which do not contain a
23         signature of the registrant, the commission receiving the
24         change of address notification shall mail a notice to the
25         registrant at the new residence address requesting
26         verification of the address change. If the change of
27         address is to a new residence outside the commission's
28         jurisdiction, the commission shall mail the following
29         notice:
30         Date................
1               Office of the Registration Commission
2                  .......... County, Pennsylvania
3           ........ (Address and Telephone No. of County)
4         We have been notified by the Department of Transportation
5         that you recently changed your address from
6         ................. (old residence address) to
7         ............... (new residence address) and that this
8         change of address is to serve as a change of address for
9         voter registration purposes. Unless you notify this
10         office within ten days from the date of this notice that
11         this information is not correct, your voter registration
12         will be transferred to ........... County. You may notify
13         this office by writing your residence address, the date
14         and your signature on the bottom of this form and mailing
15         this notice to this office. You need not notify this
16         office if this information is correct.
17                                 ............................
18                                                Chief Clerk
19         If the address change is within the commission's
20         jurisdiction, the commission shall mail a voter's
21         identification card to the registrant at the new
22         residence address.
23             (iii)  If the registrant does not return the notice
24         under subparagraph (ii) within the ten-day period, the
25         commission shall process the change of address according
26         to subparagraph (i). If the registrant notifies the
27         commission that the information is incorrect and the
28         commission is satisfied with the registrant's explanation
29         of the discrepancy, the address of the registrant's
30         registration shall remain unchanged. If the verification
1         notification or voter identification card is returned by
2         the post office as undeliverable as addressed or with a
3         forwarding address, the commission shall send a
4         confirmation notice to the registrant's address of former
5         residence in accordance with section 1901(d)(2) (relating
6         to removal of electors).
7         (5)  Upon notification and confirmation of any change of
8     address, a commission shall promptly update information
9     contained in its registration record.
10     (d)  Prohibition.--An individual who is not a qualified
11  elector is ineligible to register to vote under this section.
12     (e)  Effect.--Failure to properly complete a voter
13  registration application shall not affect the validity of an
14  application for a driver's license, a renewal application or an
15  identification card application.
16     (f)  Use of information.--No information regarding a
17  declination to register to vote in connection with an
18  application made under this section may be used for any purpose
19  other than voter registration.
20     (g)  Staff.--Agents and employees working on behalf of the
21  Department of Transportation assisting in the completion of
22  voter registration applications shall conduct themselves in a
23  manner consistent with the following principles:
24         (1)  They shall not seek to influence an applicant's
25     political preference or party registration or display
26     political preference or party allegiance.
27         (2)  They shall not make a statement to an applicant or
28     take an action the purpose or effect of which is to
29     discourage the applicant from registering to vote.
30         (3)  Applicants wishing to register to vote under this
1     section shall be given the same degree of assistance with the
2     voter registration application as with all other Department
3     of Transportation forms.
4  Agency employees who violate this subsection shall be removed
5  from employment, provided that the agency at its discretion may
6  impose a penalty of suspension without pay for at least 30 days,
7  but not more than 120 days, if it finds that the violation does
8  not warrant termination.
9  § 1324.  Application by mail.
10     (a)  General rule.--An application to register to vote or to
11  change party enrollment or name or address on a current
12  registration may be submitted by voter registration mail
13  application in the manner set forth in this section. An
14  application may be submitted by mail or by representative to the
15  commission on an official mail registration application, the
16  form of which shall be determined and prescribed by the
17  secretary or the Federal Election Commission pursuant to the
18  National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-31, 42
19  U.S.C. § 1973gg et seq.). The applicant must complete the
20  information required on the registration application and sign
21  the registration declaration.
22     (b)  Time.--Registration under this section may be made at
23  any time. If a registration application is received by a
24  commission beyond the deadline for registration provided in
25  section 1326 (relating to time), the application shall be
26  retained by the commission until the beginning of the next
27  period during which registration can be made.
28     (c)  Military electors.--
29         (1)  A military elector may apply at any time for

3     this section with respect to residence shall remain as the
4     same home residence status from which the military elector is
5     qualified to register. If, at the time of leaving that home
6     address, the military elector had not resided in this
7     Commonwealth or in a particular election district for a
8     sufficient time to have been entitled to be registered but,
9     by continued residence, would have become entitled to be
10     registered, the military elector shall be entitled to be
11     registered at the time the military elector would have been
12     entitled to register had the military elector not left that
13     home address but continued to reside there.
14         (3)  The commission is authorized to consider a request
15     for an absentee ballot as a request for an official
16     registration application and to forward to the requester all
17     of the following:
18             (i)  An absentee ballot and balloting material.
19             (ii)  An official registration application.
20         (4)  The military elector must complete and file these
21     documents in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
22     act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the
23     Pennsylvania Election Code.
24         (5)  The right to be registered pursuant to this
25     subsection shall not be subject to challenge for any reason
26     other than failure to have furnished the commission a
27     properly completed registration application.
28  § 1325.  Government agencies.
29     (a)  General rule.--The secretary shall administer a system
30  whereby all offices in this Commonwealth that provide public
1  assistance, each county clerk of orphan's court, including each
2  marriage license bureau, all offices in this Commonwealth that
3  provide State-funded programs primarily engaged in providing
4  services to persons with disabilities and all armed forces
5  recruitment centers do all of the following:

13     commission.
14     (b)  Forms.--An agency designated in subsection (a) shall

18         (1)  The question, "If you are not registered to vote
19     where you live now, would you like to apply to register to
20     vote today?"
21         (2)  If the agency provides public assistance, the
22     statement, "Applying to register or declining to register to
23     vote will not affect the amount of assistance that you will
24     be provided by this agency."
25         (3)  Boxes for the applicant to check to indicate whether
26     the applicant would like to register or decline to register

1     finds that the individual is a registered elector of the
2     county, the commission shall verify the address change with
3     the registered elector in accordance with this part. Upon
4     verifying that the registered elector has moved to another
5     county of residence, the commission shall cancel the
6     registered elector's registration, transfer a copy of the
7     canceled registration record to the commission of the
8     registered elector's new county of residence and retain a
9     record of the transfer. The commission of both counties shall
10     promptly update information contained in their registration

5  system as maintained by the commission.
6     (d)  Registration cards.--Before a commission is connected to
7  the SURE system, if a commission uses the original registration

9  register, the duplicate registration cards or photocopies of the
10  original registration cards shall be placed in exact
11  alphabetical order by last name of the registrant, shall be
12  indexed and shall be kept at the office of the registration
13  commission in a manner as to be properly safeguarded. These
14  cards constitute the general register of the county. They may
15  not be removed from the office of the commission except upon
16  order of a court of record. Nothing in this part shall preclude
17  the use of duplicate registration cards from applications
18  provided under the act of March 30, 1937 (P.L.115, No.40), known

24     (e)  Digitized signature lists.--Before a commission is

27  registration cards shall be placed in exact alphabetical order
28  by last name of the registrant, indexed and kept at the office
29  of the commission in a manner as to be properly safeguarded.
30  These original cards constitute the general register of the
1  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
2  commission except upon order of a court of record. The
3  commission shall safely retain all registration cards used in
4  the registration of electors or in conducting an election. If a
5  commission has the capability to accept an electronic
6  application, the secretary may require the commission to produce
7  a computer-generated card to file in the general register. If
8  the commission finds a record for a registrant on the computer
9  database which is not contained in the general register, it
10  shall replace the original card with a computer-generated
11  duplicate card upon written permission from the registrant or
12  upon order of a court of record.
13     (f)  Duplicate files.--Before a commission is connected to

23         (3)  The photographs, microphotographs or other
24     reproductions are open to public inspection and provision is
25     made for preserving, examining and using them.
26  § 1402.  District registers.
27     (a)  Registration card file.--
28         (1)  Except as provided in subsection (b) and in section
29     1401(e) (relating to general register), the original
30     registration cards shall be filed by election districts in
1     exact alphabetical order by last name of the registrant and
2     shall be indexed.
3         (2)  The cards constitute the district register.
4         (3)  The commission shall provide binders, which are
5     capable of being locked, for filing and indexing the
6     registration cards. The keys to the binders shall at all
7     times be retained by the commission.

12     (b)  Computer lists.--
13         (1)  Before a commission is connected to the SURE system,
14     instead of using registration cards as the district register
15     as provided in subsection (a), a commission may use a
16     computer list or computer-generated cards containing the
17     registered electors arranged by election district,
18     alphabetically by last name of the registrant. The computer
19     list or computer-generated cards must be in a form prescribed
20     by the secretary and must contain necessary information that
21     would otherwise be available on the registration cards,
22     including a legible digitized signature of the registrant
23     copied from the signature on the registration card. The
24     district election officials shall have computer printouts at
25     the polling places containing the necessary information
26     needed to verify the identity of the elector. The digitized
27     signature list shall be open to public inspection, subject to
28     reasonable safeguards, rules and regulations.
29         (2)  After a commission is connected to the SURE system,

1     computer list to be used as the district register. For each
2     election district, the list shall contain the names of the
3     registered electors of the election district, alphabetically
4     by last name of each registered elector. Each page of the
5     list shall contain the name of the county, the election
6     district, the date of the election and the date and time the
7     list was prepared. The computer list shall be in a form
8     prescribed by the secretary and must contain necessary
9     information that would otherwise be available in the general
10     register, including a legible digitized or electronic
11     signature, the street address and political party of each
12     registered elector, and suitable space for insertion of the
13     signature of the registered elector and for insertion by the
14     proper election official of the number and letter of the stub
15     of the ballot issued to the registered elector or the
16     registered elector's number in the order of admission to the
17     voting systems and the initials of the election official who
18     enters the record of voting in the district register and
19     whether the elector needs assistance to vote and, if so, the
20     nature of the disability. The district register shall be kept
21     at the office of the commission and shall be open to public
22     inspection, subject to reasonable safeguards, rules and
23     regulations.
24         (3)  Before connection to the SURE system, a commission
25     may, during systems conversion periods or emergency
26     conditions, provide for a district register containing the
27     original registration cards. The following apply:
28             (i)  The original registration cards shall be filed
29         by election district, in one of the following orders, as
30         determined by the commission:
1                 (A)  Exact alphabetical order by last name of
2             registrant.
3                 (B)  Order in which registrants' residences
4             appear upon the streets of the election district, in
5             exact alphabetical order by last name of registrant
6             for each residence.
7             (ii)  The district register containing registration
8         cards shall be kept at the office of the commission and
9         shall be open for public inspection, subject to
10         reasonable safeguards and regulations and to the
11         provisions of this part.
12     (c)  Accuracy.--It is the duty of the commission to compare
13  and correct the general register and district registers to
14  ensure their accuracy. By noon of the third day preceding an
15  election, the commission shall correct the district register for
16  each election district consistent with the information contained
17  in the general register.
18     (d)  Delivery.--The commission shall deliver, in the manner
19  required by law for delivery of election materials, the district
20  register to the election officers for use on election day.
21     (e)  Form.--District registers shall be enclosed within a
22  case or container and shall be locked and sealed by the
23  commission before delivery. The district register shall have
24  printed or written thereon the words "District Register of
25  Electors" and the district and ward, if any.
26     (f)  Examination.--Immediately following each election, the
27  commission shall cause each district register to be examined.
28  The commission specifically shall compare the signature of each
29  elector on each voter's certificate with his signature in the
30  district register and shall report in writing to the district
1  attorney any evidence or indication of probable fraud,
2  impersonation or forgery which may appear to the commission by
3  reason of the comparison. In the case of any elector whom the
4  election officers shall have recorded as removed, deceased, or
5  challenged and prevented from voting, the commission shall
6  ascertain the facts and shall correct the general and district
7  registers in accordance with Chapter 15 (relating to changes in
8  records).

12  election district a list of the names and addresses of all
13  registered electors as of that date resident in the district.

9         (1)  A commission shall provide for computer inquiries
10     concerning individual registered electors. With respect to
11     each registered elector who is the subject of an inquiry, the

17     information list containing the name, address, date of birth
18     and voting history of each registered elector in the county.
19         (2)  The list may also include information on voting
20     districts.
21         (3)  The list may not contain the digitized or electronic
22     signature or SURE registration number of the registered
23     elector.

30     names of registered electors from the list may use
1     information contained in the list for purposes unrelated to
2     elections, political activities or law enforcement. Before
3     inspecting the list or obtaining names of registered electors
4     or other information from the list, the individual must
5     provide identification to the public official having custody
6     of the public information list and must state in writing that

8     purposes unrelated to elections, political activities or law
9     enforcement.
10     (c)  Copies.--
11         (1)  The commission shall provide paper copies of the

4     declination to register to vote or to the identity of a voter
5     registration agency through which any particular qualified
6     elector is registered.
7         (2)  The records preserved under paragraph (1) shall
8     include lists of the names and addresses of all electors to

8     electors who are registered in the county.
9         (2)  The notice shall be printed upon cards suitable for
10     mailing, addressed to the office of the commission. The

18         (3)  The notice shall contain a statement that the
19     registered elector may, by filling out properly and signing a
20     removal notice and returning it to the office of the
21     commission, secure the transfer of registration effective as
22     to elections at least 30 days after the date of removal into
23     the new district.
24         (4)  The notice shall contain a warning to the registered
25     elector that the notice will not be accepted as an
26     application for transfer of the elector's registration unless
27     the signature thereon can be identified by the commission as
28     the elector's signature as it appears on file with the
29     commission.
30         (5)  The notice shall contain a warning to the registered
1     elector that the notice must be received by the commission
2     not later than 30 days before an election. If mailed, the
3     notice must be postmarked not later than the deadline for
4     registration or, in the case of an illegible or missing
5     postmark, received within five days of the close of
6     registration.
7     (b)  Use.--A registered elector who removes residence from
8  one place to another within the same county must notify the
9  commission by filing a removal notice under subsection (a), or a
10  signed request for renewal that contains the information
11  required in subsection (a), with the commission not later than
12  the registration deadline before an election. If mailed, the
13  notice or request must be postmarked not later than the deadline
14  for registration or, in the case of an illegible or missing

16  registration. The following apply:
17         (1)  An official registration application of an elector
18     who has registered by mail qualifies as a removal notice.
19         (2)  A registered elector who removes residence from one
20     place to another within the same county and who has not yet
21     filed a removal notice with the commission shall be permitted
22     to vote once at the elector's former polling place following
23     removal if, at the time of signing the voter's certificate,
24     the elector files with the judge of election a signed removal
25     notice properly filled out. Removal notices under this
26     paragraph shall be returned to the commission with the voting
27     check list, and the commission shall proceed to transfer the
28     registration of the elector under section 1502 (relating to
29     transfer of registration) and shall promptly update
30     information contained in its registration records. A
1     registered elector may vote in the election district of the
2     elector's former residence no more than one time following
3     the elector's removal.
4         (3)  A registered elector who removes residence from one
5     county to another county and who is not registered to vote in
6     the new county of residence shall be permitted to vote in the
7     election district in the former county of residence if, at
8     the time of signing the elector's certificate, the elector
9     files with the judge of election a signed affirmation
10     declaring the elector's new residence. A registered elector
11     may vote in the election district of the elector's former
12     residence no more than one time following the elector's
13     removal. Affirmations made under this paragraph shall be
14     returned to the commission of the elector's former county of
15     residence with the voting checklist, and that commission
16     shall proceed to transfer the registration of the elector
17     under section 1502. Upon receipt of the transfer notice, the
18     commission of the elector's new county of residence shall
19     immediately process the transfer of the elector in accordance
20     with section 1328 (relating to approval of registration
21     applications). Both commissions shall promptly update
22     information contained in their registration records.
23  § 1502.  Transfer of registration.
24     (a)  General rule.--Upon timely receipt of notification of
25  removal under section 1501(b) (relating to removal notices), the
26  commission shall proceed as follows:
27         (1)  The signature on the notification document shall be
28     compared with the signature of the registered elector as it
29     appears on file with the commission.
30         (2)  If the signature appears authentic, the commission
1     shall enter the change of residence on the registered
2     elector's registration records.
3         (3)  If a request for transfer which is determined to be
4     authentic under paragraph (2) shows a removal within the
5     period of 30 days preceding an election, the commission,
6     after such election, shall enter the change of residence on
7     the registered elector's registration record. The commission
8     shall advise the registered elector promptly in writing of
9     its action.
10         (4)  When a registered elector has filed with a
11     commission a notice that the elector has moved from the
12     county to another county, if the signature appears authentic,
13     the commission shall enter the change of residence on the
14     elector's registration records, cancel the registration of
15     the elector and notify the commission of the elector's new
16     county of residence to register the elector. Upon receipt of
17     the transfer notice, the commission of the elector's new
18     county of residence shall immediately process the transfer of
19     the elector in accordance with section 1328 (relating to
20     approval of registration applications).
21         (5)  If a request for transfer which is determined to be
22     authentic under paragraph (4) shows a removal within the
23     period of 30 days preceding an election, the commission,
24     after such election, shall enter the change of residence on
25     the elector's registration records, cancel the registration
26     of the elector and notify the commission of the elector's new
27     county of residence to register the elector. Upon receipt of
28     the transfer notice, the commission of the elector's new
29     county of residence shall immediately process the transfer of
30     the elector in accordance with section 1328.
1         (6)  A commission shall promptly update information
2     contained in its registration records.
3     (b)  Electors unable to write.--A registered elector who is
4  unable to sign the notification document may affix a mark to the
5  notification document. The mark must be affixed in the presence
6  of a witness who must sign the notification document.
7  § 1503.  Change of enrollment of political party.
8     By the deadline for registration, a registered elector who
9  desires to change the enrollment of political designation or
10  who, although registered, has not previously enrolled as a
11  member of a party may appear before a commissioner, registrar or
12  clerk or may submit an application by mail under section 1324
13  (relating to application by mail) and state in a signed writing
14  the political party in which the registered elector desires to
15  be enrolled. If the signature of the elector is verified by
16  comparison with the registered elector's signature as it appears
17  on file with the commission, the commissioner, registrar or
18  clerk shall make the change in its registration records. If
19  supported by other evidence of identity, a mark may be made in
20  lieu of a signature by a registered elector who is unable to
21  write. The mark must be made in the presence of a witness who
22  must sign the registration application.
23  § 1504.  Disability.
24     (a)  Eligibility.--If a registered elector by reason of
25  blindness, disability or inability to read or write is unable to
26  read the names on the ballot or on the voting machine labels or
27  is unable to see or mark the ballot or operate the voting
28  machine or to enter the voting compartment or voting machine
29  booth without assistance, the following apply:
30         (1)  The elector may, at least ten days prior to the next
1     election, personally make application to the commission or a
2     registrar or a clerk.
3         (2)  The application must request the entry of the exact
4     nature of the disability on the elector's registration card.
5         (3)  The commission shall make the entry as appropriate.
6         (4)  If the disability is not entered on the registration
7     card, the elector may receive assistance if the elector
8     completes a declaration in the polling place.
9         (5)  Following the election the commission shall examine
10     declarations completed under this section and shall update
11     the elector's voter registration card to reflect the need for
12     assistance and the nature of the disability.
13     (b)  Termination.--If the commission ascertains that a
14  registered elector who has declared need for assistance is no
15  longer in need of assistance, it shall cancel on the
16  registration record the entry relating to illiteracy or
17  disability which authorized assistance. The commission shall
18  notify the elector by mail of its action.
19  § 1505.  Death of registrant.

24  of age or older, send the name and address of residence of that
25  individual to a commission in a manner and on a form prescribed
26  by the department. The commission shall promptly update
27  information contained in its registration records.
28     (b)  Other sources.--A commission may also utilize published
29  newspaper obituaries, letters testamentary or letters of
30  administration issued by the office of the registrar of wills to
1  cancel and remove the registration of an elector, provided that
2  such removals are uniform, nondiscriminatory and in compliance
3  with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Public Law 89-110, 42 U.S.C.
4  § 1973 et seq.). The commission shall promptly update
5  information contained in its registration records.
6     (c)  Corrections.--An individual incorrectly reported
7  deceased by the Department of Health or incorrectly removed by a
8  commission for reason of death may appear in person before a

11  correct its registration records.
12  § 1506.  Checkup of registers.
13     (a)  General rule.--At any time prior to the 30th day
14  preceding an election, a commission may mail to any qualified
15  elector whose name appears in any district register a notice

17  the register and requesting the elector in case of any error to
18  present the notice within ten days at the office of the
19  commission to have the error corrected and warning that any
20  discrepancy between the qualified elector's actual name and
21  address and his name and address as recorded in the original
22  register will constitute ground for challenging the elector's
23  vote. The notice shall contain on the outside, "Do not forward,

2  the commission may conduct a checkup of each registered elector
3  by either of the methods provided for in subsections (a) and
4  (b).
5     (d)  Failure to deliver notice.--Upon the return by the
6  postal service of any notice which it has been unable to deliver
7  at the given address because the addressee cannot be found there
8  or upon report by the postal service that any registered elector
9  does not reside at the address given on the registration card,
10  the commission shall do one of the following:
11         (1)  Direct an authorized employee to visit in person the
12     address of the qualified elector and, if the employee finds
13     that the qualified elector does not reside at the address, to
14     leave at the address the notice prescribed by subsection (e).
15         (2)  Mail to the registered elector at the address given

19     it if the addressee does not reside at the address given
20     thereon.
21     (e)  Communication with commission.--The notice stipulated by
22  subsection (d) shall require the registered elector to
23  communicate with the commission by a date designated by the
24  commission, which shall be not less than ten days nor more than
25  30 days from the service or mailing of the notice and, in any

1  qualified elector, except that, if a registered elector who has
2  been mailed the notice prescribed by this subsection
3  communicates with the commission claiming the right to remain
4  registered at the address to which the original notice was
5  mailed, the commission shall investigate and, if not satisfied
6  of the right of the registered elector to remain registered at
7  the address, shall cancel the registration of the elector. Every
8  elector whose registration is canceled under this section must
9  register in the manner provided by this part in order to be
10  eligible to vote at any election.
11     (f)  Elector in military service.--The registration of a
12  person in military service shall not be canceled by reason of
13  the failure of the person to reside at the address appearing
14  upon the district register if the person resided at the address
15  on the date of entering military service.
16  § 1507.  Canvass of registered electors.
17     (a)  Verification.--The commission may, by individual
18  commissioners or by inspectors of registration, verify the

22  of the name and address of each person registered who is not
23  found to reside at the address from which the person is

7  number of election districts which the commission determines to
8  canvass. They must be qualified electors of the county. They
9  shall be appointed without reference to residence in election
10  districts or to their political affiliations or beliefs. The
11  commission shall instruct each special inspector in discharging
12  duties.
13  § 1508.  Comparison and correction of registers.
14     Commencing 30 days prior to each election, the commission

27         would be presented has been given personally to the
28         registered elector at least 24 hours prior to the
29         presentation of the petition; or
30             (ii)  the registered elector could not be found at
1         the place given in the district register as residence and
2         the person in charge of that place, whose name must be
3         given in the petition, has declared that the person was
4         well acquainted with the names of all individuals
5         residing at the place and that the registered elector had
6         never been or was no longer one of them or that no such
7         individual is residing at the address.
8     (b)  Action.--Upon receipt of a petition under subsection
9  (a), the commission shall cancel or suspend the registration of
10  the registered elector and amend accordingly the general and
11  district registers and other records affected unless the
12  registered elector so registered appears and shows cause why
13  this action should not be taken.
14  § 1510.  Failure to vote.
15     (a)  Check of electors.--By April 1 of each year except in a
16  year in which the commission conducts a check of electors under

18  commission shall examine all of the district registers.
19     (b)  Suspension.--A qualified elector who has been registered

21  years but who is not recorded as having voted at an election
22  during that period is subject to suspension of registration in
23  accordance with the following procedure:
24         (1)  If a registered elector who has been registered for
25     a period of at least two immediately preceding calendar years
26     is not recorded as having voted at an election during that
27     period, the commission shall send to the registered elector

3             shall send the elector, to the address recorded on
4             the elector's registration, a notice of the change of
5             address by forwardable mail and a postage prepaid,
6             preaddressed return form by which the elector may
7             verify or correct the address information.
8                 (B)  If it appears from the information provided
9             through the United States Postal Service that a
10             registered elector has moved to a different residence
11             address outside the county, the commission shall use
12             the notice procedure described in clause (A).
13             (ii)  Confirmation mailing:
14                 (A)  A commission may establish a program by
15             sending a direct, nonforwardable first class "return
16             if undeliverable - address correction requested"
17             mailing to all registered electors in the county.
18                 (B)  If this program is established, the
19             commission shall use the notice procedure described
20             in subparagraph (i)(A) for any registered elector
21             whose mailing is returned undeliverable.
22         (2)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
23     program established under paragraph (1), a commission may use
24     a canvass as follows:
25             (i)  The commission may, by commissioners or by
26         inspectors of registration, verify the registration in an
27         election district by visiting the building from which an
28         elector is registered and other buildings as the
29         commission deems necessary.
30             (ii)  The commission shall make a record of the name
1         and address of each registered elector who is found not
2         to reside at the registered address or who for any other
3         reason appears to be not qualified to vote in the
4         registered election district.
5             (iii)  The commission shall leave at the address of
6         each registered elector referred to in subparagraph (ii)
7         a notice requiring him to communicate with the commission
8         on or before a date which the commission shall designate,
9         and which shall be not less than seven days and not more
10         than 15 days from the date of the notice and in any case
11         not later than the 15th day preceding the election next
12         ensuing, and satisfy the commission of his qualifications
13         as an elector. The commission shall cause a confirmation
14         of each such notice to be sent by mail promptly to the
15         registered elector at the address from which he is
16         registered. The envelope containing such information is
17         to be plainly marked that it is not to be forwarded. At
18         the expiration of the time specified in the notice, the
19         commission shall cancel the registration of the
20         registered elector who has not communicated with the
21         commission and proved his qualifications as a registered
22         elector.
23             (iv)  To facilitate the canvass under this section, a
24         commission may, when necessary, appoint special
25         inspectors of registration, in number not exceeding
26         double the number of election districts being canvassed.
27             (v)  Special inspectors must be registered electors
28         of the county. They shall be appointed without reference
29         to residence in election districts or to political
30         affiliations or beliefs. The commission shall instruct
1         special inspectors in their duties. Special inspectors
2         have the powers conferred by this part upon inspectors of
3         registration.
4         (3)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
5     program established under paragraph (1), a commission shall
6     send a notice pursuant to subsection (d) to any registered
7     elector who has not voted nor appeared to vote during the
8     period beginning five years before the date of the notice and
9     ending on the date of the notice and for whom the board of
10     elections did not during that period in any other way receive
11     any information that the elector still resides in the
12     election district.
13         (4)  A commission shall complete, not later than 90 days
14     before each municipal or general election, at least once per
15     year the voter removal programs under this section, and shall
16     promptly update information contained in its registration
17     records. This paragraph shall not be construed to preclude
18     any of the following:
19             (i)  Cancellation of an elector's registration as
20         provided for under subsection (a)(1) or (2).
21             (ii)  Correction of registration records in
22         accordance with this part.
23     (c)  Identification of inactive electors.--A commission shall
24  mark an "I" on the registration records of each registered
25  elector who has been mailed a form under subsection (b)(1) or
26  (3) and has failed to respond, which shall be included with all
27  other registration records for that polling site and located at
28  the elector's polling site on the day of the election. The
29  commission shall promptly update the information contained in
30  its registration records.
1     (d)  Cancellation of registration.--
2         (1)  A commission shall not cancel the registration of a
3     registered elector on the ground that the registered elector
4     has changed residence unless any of the following apply:
5             (i)  The registered elector confirms in writing that
6         the elector has changed residence to a location outside
7         the county in which the elector is registered.
8             (ii)  The registered elector:
9                 (A)  has failed to respond to a notice described
10             in paragraph (2); and
11                 (B)  has not voted nor appeared to vote and, if
12             necessary, corrected the commission's record of the
13             elector's address, in an election during the period
14             beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the
15             day after the date of the second general election for
16             Federal office that occurs after the date of the
17             notice.
18         (2)  A notice, as required in paragraph (1)(ii), is
19     acceptable if it is a postage prepaid and preaddressed return
20     card, sent by forwardable mail, on which the registered
21     elector may state the elector's current address, if it
22     contains a notice as follows:
23             (i)  The notice must state all of the following:
24                 (A)  If the registered elector did not change
25             residence or changed residence but still resides in
26             the county, the elector must return the card not
27             later than 30 days prior to the next election. If the
28             card is not returned, affirmation or confirmation of
29             the elector's address may be required before the
30             elector is permitted to vote in an election during
1             the period beginning on the date of the notice and
2             ending on the day after the date of the second
3             general election for Federal office that occurs after
4             the date of the notice. If the elector does not vote
5             in an election during that period, the elector's
6             registration shall be canceled.
7                 (B)  If the registered elector has changed
8             residence to a place outside the county in which the
9             elector is registered, information shall be provided
10             concerning how the elector can register in the new
11             county of residence.
12             (ii)  The notice must state the date of the notice,
13         the date of the next election and the date of the second
14         general election for Federal office occurring after the
15         date of the notice.
16         (3)  The commission shall correct registration records in
17     accordance with change of residence information obtained in
18     conformance with this subsection. The commission shall also
19     promptly update its registration records.

8  contained on the form prescribed by the secretary, which was
9  prepared or distributed by a political party and signed by a

14     Section 2.  The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall
15  promulgate regulations to establish and implement the SURE
16  system in accordance with 25 Pa.C.S. § 1222 and to implement 25
17  Pa.C.S. Pt. IV. The promulgation of regulations under this
18  section shall be exempt from:
19         (1)  Section 204(b) of the act of October 15, 1980
20     (P.L.950, No.164), known as the Commonwealth Attorneys Act.
21         (2)  The act of June 25, 1982 (P.L.633, No.181), known as
22     the Regulatory Review Act.
23     Section 3.  The following apply:
24         (1)  The provisions of 62 Pa.C.S. shall apply to the
25     development, establishment and implementation of the
26     Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors (SURE) system required
27     by 25 Pa.C.S. Ch. 12 Subch. B except as provided in this
28     section.
29         (2)  If a bidder or offeror, a prospective bidder or
30     offeror or a prospective contractor is aggrieved in
1     connection with the solicitation or award of the contract, he
2     may protest to the head of the purchasing agency in writing.
3         (3)  If the protestant is a bidder or offeror or a
4     prospective contractor, the protest shall be filed with the
5     head of the purchasing agency within seven days after the
6     aggrieved bidder or offeror or prospective contractor knew or
7     should have known of the facts giving rise to the protest
8     except that in no event may a protest be filed later than
9     seven days after the date the contract was awarded. If the
10     protestant is a prospective bidder or offeror, a protest
11     shall be filed with the head of the purchasing agency prior
12     to the bid opening time or the proposal receipt date. If a
13     bidder or offeror, a prospective bidder or offeror, or a
14     prospective contractor fails to file a protest or files an
15     untimely protest, the bidder or offeror, the prospective
16     bidder or offeror, or the prospective contractor shall be
17     deemed to have waived its right to protest the solicitation
18     or award of the contract in any forum. Untimely filed
19     protests shall be disregarded by the purchasing agency.
20         (4)  A protest shall state all grounds upon which the
21     protestant asserts the solicitation or award of the contract
22     was improper. The protestant may submit with the protest any
23     documents or information it deems relevant to the protest.
24         (5)  Within 15 days of receipt of a protest, the
25     contracting officer may submit to the head of the purchasing
26     agency and the protestant a response to the protest,
27     including any documents or information he deems relevant to
28     the protest. The protestant may file a reply to the response
29     within ten days of the date of the response.
30         (6)  The head of the purchasing agency or his designee
1     shall review the protest and any response or reply and may
2     request and review such additional documents or information
3     he deems necessary to render a decision, and may, at his sole
4     discretion, conduct a hearing. The head of the purchasing
5     agency or his designee shall provide to the protestant and
6     the contracting officer a reasonable opportunity to review
7     and address any additional documents or information deemed
8     necessary by the head of the purchasing agency or his
9     designee to render a decision.
10         (7)  Upon completing an evaluation of the protest in
11     accordance with paragraph (6), the head of the purchasing
12     agency or his designee shall issue a written determination
13     stating the reasons for the decision. The determination shall
14     be issued within 60 days of the receipt of the protest unless
15     extended by consent of the head of the purchasing agency and
16     the protestant. The determination shall be the final order of
17     the purchasing agency. If the head of the purchasing agency
18     or his designee determines that the solicitation or award of
19     the contract was contrary to law, he may enter an order
20     authorized by 62 Pa.C.S. Ch. 17 Subch. D.
21         (8)  Within 15 days of the mailing date of a final
22     determination denying a protest, a protestant may file an
23     appeal with the Commonwealth Court. Issues not raised by the
24     protestant before the purchasing agency are deemed waived and
25     may not be raised before the court.
26         (9)  The record of determination for review by the court
27     shall consist of the solicitation or award; the contract, if
28     any; the protest and any response, reply or any additional
29     documents or information considered by the head of the
30     purchasing agency or his designee; the hearing transcript and
1     exhibits, if any; and the final determination.
2         (10)  The court shall hear the appeal, without a jury, on
3     the record of determination certified by the purchasing
4     agency. The court shall affirm the determination of the
5     purchasing agency unless it finds from the record that the
6     determination is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of
7     discretion or is contrary to law.
8         (11)  If the determination is not affirmed, the court may
9     enter any order authorized by 42 Pa.C.S. § 706, provided,
10     that if the court determines that the solicitation or award
11     of the contract is contrary to law, then the remedy the court
12     shall order is limited to canceling the solicitation or award
13     and declaring void any resulting contract.
14         (12)  In the event a protest is filed timely under this
15     section and until the time has elapsed for the protestant to
16     file a petition for review in Commonwealth Court, the
17     purchasing agency may elect not to proceed further with the
18     solicitation or with the award of the contract.
19         (13)  This section shall be the exclusive procedure for
20     protesting a solicitation or award of the contract by a
21     bidder or offeror, a prospective bidder or offeror, or a
22     prospective contractor that is aggrieved in connection with
23     the solicitation or award of the contract. The provisions of
24     2 Pa.C.S. shall not apply to this section.
25     Section 4.  Section 2 of this act shall expire on December
26  31, 2002.

28  to the extent specified:
