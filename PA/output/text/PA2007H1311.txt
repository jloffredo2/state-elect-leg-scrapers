5     Section 4.  Section 976 of the act, amended July 28, 1941

8  read:
9     Section 976.  Examination of Nomination Petitions,
10  Certificates and Papers; Return of Rejected Nomination
11  Petitions, Certificates and Papers.--When any nomination
12  petition, nomination certificate or nomination paper is
13  presented in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth or
14  of any county board of elections for filing within the period
15  limited by this act, it shall be the duty of the said officer or
16  board to examine the same. No nomination petition, nomination
17  paper or nomination certificate shall be permitted to be filed
18  if--(a) it contains material errors or defects apparent on the
19  face thereof, or on the face of the appended or accompanying
20  affidavits; or (b) it contains material alterations made after
21  signing without the consent of the signers; or (c) it does not
22  contain a sufficient number of signatures as required by law;
23  Provided, however, That the Secretary of the Commonwealth or the
24  county board of elections, although not hereby required so to
25  do, may question the genuineness of any signature or signatures
26  appearing thereon, and if he or it shall thereupon find that any
27  such signature or signatures are not genuine, such signature or
28  signatures shall be disregarded in determining whether the
29  nomination petition, nomination paper or nomination certificate
30  contains a sufficient number of signatures as required by law;
1  or (d) in the case of nomination petitions, if nomination
2  petitions have been filed for printing the name of the same
3  person for the same office[, except the office of judge of a
4  court of common pleas, the Philadelphia Municipal Court or the
5  Traffic Court of Philadelphia, or the office of school director
6  in districts where that office is elective or the office of
7  justice of the peace] upon the official ballot of more than one
8  political party; or (e) in the case of nomination papers, if the
9  candidate named therein has filed a nomination petition for any
10  public office for the ensuing primary, or has been nominated for
11  any such office by nomination papers previously filed; or (f) if
12  the nomination petitions or papers are not accompanied by the
13  filing fee or certified check required for said office; or (g)
14  in the case of nomination papers, the appellation set forth
15  therein is identical with or deceptively similar to the words
16  used by any existing party or by any political body which has
17  already filed nomination papers for the same office, or if the
18  appellation set forth therein contains part of the name, or an
19  abbreviation of the name or part of the name of an existing
20  political party, or of a political body which has already filed
21  nomination papers for the same office. The invalidity of any
22  sheet of a nomination petition or nomination paper shall not
23  affect the validity of such petition or paper if a sufficient
24  petition or paper remains after eliminating such invalid sheet.
25  The action of said officer or board in refusing to receive and
26  file any such nomination petition, certificate or paper, may be
27  reviewed by the court upon an application to compel its
28  reception as of the date when it was presented to the office of
29  such officer or board: Provided, however, That said officer or
30  board shall be entitled to a reasonable time in which to examine
1  any petitions, certificates or papers, and to summon and
2  interrogate the candidates named therein, or the persons
3  presenting said petitions, certificates or papers, and his or
4  their retention of same for the purpose of making such
5  examination or interrogation shall not be construed as an
6  acceptance or filing.
7     Upon completion of any examination, if any nomination
8  petition, certificate or paper is found to be defective, it
9  shall forthwith be rejected and returned to the candidate or one
10  of the candidates named therein, together with a statement of
11  the reasons for such rejection:
12     Provided further, That no nomination petition, nomination
13  paper or nomination certificate shall be permitted to be filed,
14  if the political party or political body referred to therein
15  shall be composed of a group of electors whose purposes or aims,
16  or one of whose purposes or aims, is the establishment, control,
17  conduct, seizure or overthrow of the Government of the
18  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States of America by
19  the use of force, violence, military measure or threats of one
20  or more of the foregoing. The authority to reject such
21  nomination petition, paper or certificate for this reason shall,
22  when filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth, be vested in
23  a committee composed of the Governor, the Attorney General and
24  the Secretary of the Commonwealth, and when filed with any
25  county board of elections shall be vested in such board. If in
26  such case the committee or board, as the case may be, shall
27  conclude that the acceptance of such nomination petition, paper
28  or certificate should be refused, it shall within two days of
29  the filing of such nomination petition, paper or certificate fix
30  a place and a time five days in advance for hearing the matter,
1  and notice thereof shall be given to all parties affected
2  thereby. At the time and place so fixed the committee or board,
3  as the case may be, shall hear testimony, but shall not be bound
4  by technical rules of evidence. The testimony presented shall be
5  stenographically recorded and made a part of the record of the
6  committee or board. Within two days after such hearing the
7  committee or board, if satisfied upon competent evidence that
8  the said nomination petition, paper or certificate is not
9  entitled to be accepted and filed, it shall announce its
10  decision and immediately notify the parties affected thereby.
11  Failure to announce decision within two days after such hearing
12  shall be conclusive that such nomination petition, paper or
13  certificate has been accepted and filed. The decision of said
14  committee or board in refusing to accept and file such
15  nomination petition, paper or certificate may be reviewed by the
16  court upon an application to compel its reception as of the date
17  when presented to the Secretary of the Commonwealth or such
18  board. The application shall be made within two days of the time
19  when such decision is announced. If the application is properly
20  made, any judge of said court may fix a time and place for
21  hearing the matter in dispute, of which notice shall be served
22  with a copy of said application upon the Secretary of the
23  Commonwealth or the county board of elections, as the case may
24  be. At the time so fixed, the court, or any judge thereof
25  assigned for the purpose, shall hear the case de novo. If after
26  such hearing the said court shall find that the decision of the
27  committee or the board was erroneous, it shall issue its mandate
28  to the committee or board to correct its decision and to accept
29  and file the nomination paper, petition or certificate. From any
30  decision of the court an appeal may be taken within two days
1  after the entry thereof. It shall be the duty of the said court
2  to fix the hearing and to announce its decision within such
3  period of time as will permit the Secretary of the Commonwealth
4  or the county board of elections to permit the names of the
5  candidates affected by the court's decision to be printed on the
6  ballot, if the court should so determine.

3  which is not set to expire in the same year as the office
4  subject to the affidavit.

19  number may be detached from the ballot before it is deposited in
20  the ballot box and beside that corner shall also be printed,
21  "Remove numbered stub immediately before depositing your ballot
22  in ballot box."
23     Section 7.  This act shall take effect immediately.
