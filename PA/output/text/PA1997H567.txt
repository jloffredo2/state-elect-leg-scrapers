14     Section 1.  The act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known
15  as the Pennsylvania Election Code, is amended by adding an
16  article to read:
17                            ARTICLE XI-B
18                          WRITE-IN BALLOTS
19     Section 1101-B.  Write-In Votes.--(a)  Any registered elector
20  may cast a write-in vote for a candidate in a general, primary
21  or special election under the prescribed method of voting used
1  by the county or municipality as set forth by Article X, XI or
2  XI-A of this act. However, write-in votes shall not be counted
3  for any candidate who has not filed a declaration of intent to
4  be a write-in candidate pursuant to this article. A qualified
5  person who has filed a declaration of intent may receive write-
6  in votes at either a primary, general or special election. A
7  candidate, except one whose candidacy is to be submitted to
8  electors throughout the entire State, shall file a declaration
9  of intent to be a write-in candidate before 4 o'clock P. M. of
10  the seventh day preceding the election at which the candidacy is
11  to be considered. Whenever the election is to be determined by
12  electors of a county or a district or subdivision within the
13  county, the declaration shall be filed with the board of
14  elections of that county. Whenever the election is to be
15  determined by electors of a subdivision located in more than one
16  county, the declaration shall be filed with the board of
17  election of the county in which the voting residence of the
18  candidate is maintained. Whenever the election is to be
19  determined by electors of a district comprised of more than one
20  county but less than all of the counties of the State, the
21  declaration shall be filed with the board of elections in which
22  the voting residence of the candidate is maintained. A candidate
23  for an office to be voted upon by electors throughout the entire
24  State shall file a declaration of intent to be a write-in
25  candidate with the Secretary of the Commonwealth before 4
26  o'clock P. M. on the seventh day preceding the election at which
27  the candidacy is to be considered.
28     (b)  If a candidate whose name is printed on the ballot dies
29  later than 4 o'clock P. M. on the seventh day preceding the
30  election at which the candidacy is to be considered, write-in
1  votes shall be counted for persons who have filed declarations
2  of intent to be write-in candidates for the office for which the
3  deceased was a candidate. A declaration of intent filed
4  subsequent to a candidate's death shall be filed with the proper
5  election officials not later than 12 o'clock noon on the Monday
6  immediately preceding the election. In this case the intended
7  write-in candidate shall include in his declaration of intent a
8  statement affirming that, to the best of his knowledge, the
9  candidate whose place on the ballot he seeks is deceased.
10     (c)  It shall be the responsibility of the Secretary of the
11  Commonwealth and the county election board receiving the
12  declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate to notify
13  affected county election boards of a candidate filing a
14  declaration to be a write-in candidate. A list of the qualified
15  write-in candidates shall be furnished by the board of elections
16  of the county to the district election boards. It shall be
17  prominently displayed by them in the polling places during
18  polling hours along with a copy of the specimen ballots.
19     (d)  This article shall not apply to the nomination and
20  election of members of district election boards.
21     (e)  The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall prescribe the
22  form of the declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate.
23     Section 2.  This act shall take effect immediately.
