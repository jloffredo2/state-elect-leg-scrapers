19  * *
20     (e.1)  Any qualified registered elector, including any
21  qualified bedridden or hospitalized veteran, who is unable
1  because of illness or physical disability to attend his polling
2  place on the day of any primary or election or operate a voting
3  machine and state distinctly and audibly that he is unable to do
4  so as required by section 1218 of this act [may,] shall, upon
5  application and with the certification by his attending
6  physician that he is permanently disabled, and physically unable
7  to attend the polls or operate a voting machine and make the
8  distinct and audible statement required by section 1218 appended
9  to the application hereinbefore required, be placed on a
10  permanently disabled absentee ballot list file. An absentee
11  ballot application shall be mailed to every such person for each
12  primary or election so long as he does not lose his voting
13  rights by failure to vote as otherwise required by this act.
14  Such person shall not be required to file a physician's
15  certificate of disability with each application as required in
16  subsection (e) of this section but such person must submit a
17  written statement asserting continuing disability every four
18  years in order to maintain his eligibility to vote under the
19  provisions of this subsection. Should any such person lose his
20  disability he shall inform the county board of elections of the
21  county of his residence. No person shall be placed on a
22  permanently disabled absentee ballot list file without express
23  voluntary authorization by the person permitting the county
24  board of elections to do so. Further, persons placed on a
25  permanently disabled absentee ballot list file may require the
26  county board of elections to remove their names from such list
27  at any time without condition by submitting a written statement
28  to the county board of elections requesting such action. No
29  person shall be placed on a permanently disabled absentee ballot
30  list file solely based on the accessibility, inaccessibility or
1  physical condition of polling places in the county in which the
2  person is registered to vote.
