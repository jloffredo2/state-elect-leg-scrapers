20     (a)  Each candidate for nomination or election at any
21  election shall be entitled to appoint two watchers in each
22  election district in which such candidate is voted for. Each
1  political party and each political body which has nominated
2  candidates in accordance with the provisions of this act, shall
3  be entitled to appoint three watchers at any general, municipal
4  or special election in each election district in which the
5  candidates of such party or political body are to be voted for.
6  Such watchers shall serve without expense to the county.
7     (b)  All watchers so appointed shall serve in only one
8  district and must be qualified registered electors of the
9  [municipality or township] county in which the district where
10  they are authorized to act is located. Only one watcher for each
11  candidate at primaries, or for each party or political body at
12  general, municipal or special elections, shall be allowed to
13  remain in the polling place at any one time prior to the close
14  of the polls, and all watchers in the room shall remain outside
15  the enclosed space. After the close of the polls and while the
16  ballots are being counted or voting machine canvassed, all the
17  watchers shall be permitted to be in the polling place outside
18  the enclosed space. Each watcher shall be provided with a
19  certificate from the county board of elections, stating his name
20  and the name of the candidate, party or political body he
21  represents. Watchers shall be required to show their
22  certificates when requested to do so. Watchers allowed in the
23  polling place under the provisions of this act, shall be
24  permitted to keep a list of voters and shall be entitled to
25  challenge any person making application to vote and to require
26  proof of his qualifications, as provided by this act. All
27  watchers so appointed as set forth above, who are to serve in a
28  [district] municipality other than the one from which they are
29  registered electors, are to be appointed on petition to the
30  court of common pleas. Said petition shall set forth that the
1  watcher is a qualified voter of the [municipality or township]
2  county in which the district is located and that said watcher is
3  a law abiding citizen and of good repute, and the court shall
4  consider all factors relevant to said petition before granting
5  or refusing same.
6     (c)  No candidate or committee of a political party or of a
7  political body, nor any other person or persons shall pay to any
8  watcher compensation in excess of twenty ($20.00) dollars per
9  diem.
10     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
