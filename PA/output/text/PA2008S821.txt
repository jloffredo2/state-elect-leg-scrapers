5     [Section 912.2.  Nominations by Minor Political Parties.--(a)
6  Notwithstanding any other provision in this act to the contrary,
7  minor political parties shall nominate all of their candidates
8  for the offices to be filled at the ensuing November election
9  pursuant to section 903 in accordance with the requirements of
10  section 951, other than subsection (e)(6) and (7) thereof, and
11  section 954, and shall obtain the required signatures during the
12  same time frame available to political bodies. Minor political
13  parties shall be subject to the provisions of this act
14  applicable to political parties with respect to special
15  elections, voter registration forms, substituted nominations and
16  all other purposes except as otherwise expressly provided in
17  this section. "Minor political party" shall mean a political
18  party as defined in section 801(a) or (b) whose State-wide
19  registration is less than fifteen per centum of the combined
20  State-wide registration for all State-wide political parties as
21  of the close of the registration period immediately preceding
22  the most recent November election. The Secretary of the
23  Commonwealth shall prescribe forms or, if there is insufficient
24  time, make appropriate conforming changes in existing forms to
25  carry out the purposes of this section.
26     (b)  All nomination papers circulated and filed pursuant to
27  this section shall specify--(1) the name or appellation of the

2  the name of each candidate nominated therein, his profession,
3  business or occupation, if any, and his place of residence with
4  street and number, if any; and (3) the office for which such
5  candidate is nominated. No words shall be used in any nomination
6  paper to designate the name or appellation of the minor
7  political party represented by the candidate's name in such
8  nomination paper which are identical with or deceptively similar
9  to the words used for a like purpose by any minor political
10  party which has already filed nomination papers for the same
11  office. Any petition to set aside a nomination paper on account
12  of the name or appellation used therein, or involving the right
13  of the signers thereof to use such name or appellation, or on
14  any other account, shall be decided as in the case of other
15  petitions to set aside nomination papers, in the manner provided
16  by this article.
17     (c)  Each person filing any nomination paper for public
18  office shall be given a statement composed by the Secretary of
19  the Commonwealth setting forth his duties under law to file pre-
20  election and post-election campaign finance reports and the
21  penalties for nonfiling. Each person filing any nomination paper
22  for public office shall be given a form to file expenses if the
23  amount received or expended or liabilities incurred shall exceed
24  the sum of two hundred fifty dollars ($250), and a form
25  containing a sworn statement that the amount received or
26  expended or liabilities incurred do not exceed the sum of two
27  hundred fifty dollars ($250), with written instructions prepared
28  by the Secretary of the Commonwealth. Within three weeks after
29  such candidate has filed, the appropriate supervisor shall mail
30  the same forms and instructions to such candidate by first class
1  mail.]
