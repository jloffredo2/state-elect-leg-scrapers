13  county board of elections shall conduct hand counts of the
14  voter-verified paper records as specified in this subsection
15  shall be made publicly by the county board of elections on an
16  entirely random basis using a uniform distribution in which all
17  precincts in a county have an equal chance of being selected.

4  count in the precinct as announced by the county board of
5  elections as specified in clause (2)(i)(A), broken down by the
6  categories of votes described in clause (2)(ii) and (iii). Any
7  discrepancies between the corresponding audit results and
