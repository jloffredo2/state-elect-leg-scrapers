20     of abode.
21         (4)  If an individual removes to another state with the
22     intention of making that state the permanent residence, the
23     individual shall be considered to have lost residence in this
24     Commonwealth.
25         (5)  If an individual removes to another state with the
26     intention of remaining there an indefinite time and making
27     that state the place of residence, the individual shall be
28     considered to have lost residence in this Commonwealth,
29     notwithstanding an intention to return at some indefinite
30     future period.
1         (6)  If an individual goes into another state and, while

3     individual shall be considered to have lost residence in this
4     Commonwealth.
5         (7)  An individual employed in the service of the Federal
6     Government or of the Commonwealth and required thereby to be
7     absent from the municipality where the individual resided
8     when entering that employment, and the spouse of the
9     individual, may remain registered in the district where the
10     individual resided immediately prior to entering that
11     employment; and the individual and the spouse shall be

21         the employment. The commission shall retain certificates
22         under this subparagraph.
23             (ii)  The commission shall note on the registration
24         card of each individual registered under this paragraph
25         the fact of Federal or State employment.

27         shall verify the employment of the individuals registered
28         under this paragraph at the proper Federal or State
29         office. If an individual is found to be no longer a
30         Federal or State employee, the individual's registration
1         shall be canceled under Chapter 9.

20     person's name, address and telephone number. If such person
21     is an employee or agent of the Department of Transportation
22     or another agency, as provided under section 525, and is

30     discourage the applicant from registering to vote.
1         (3)  They shall not make any statement to an applicant or

4     register has any bearing on the availability of services or
5     benefits.
6  Agency employees who violate this subsection shall be removed
7  from employment, provided that the agency at its discretion may
8  impose a penalty of suspension without pay for at least 30 days,

10  not warrant termination.
11  Section 528.  Approval of registration applications.
12     (a)  Examination.--
13         (1)  Official registration applications submitted to a
14     registration commission shall be examined by the commissioner
15     or a clerk or registrar upon receipt.
16         (2)  If the official voter registration application
17     submission is in person, the application shall be attested
18     and dated by the commissioner, clerk or registrar.
19         (3)  Upon receipt of any other voter registration
20     application, the commission shall make an entry of the date
21     received on the application. If the applicant does not reside
22     within the commission's county, but resides elsewhere in this
23     Commonwealth, the commission shall forward the application
24     card to the proper commission and make a record of the
25     forwarding.
26     (b)  Decision.--
27         (1)  If the commission finds the official registration
28     application not properly completed, the application shall be
29     rejected. The commission should make reasonable efforts to
30     complete the registration before rejecting it for omissions
1     and inconsistencies. If the commission rejects an application
2     under this paragraph, it shall indicate "REJECTED" on the
3     application and state there the reason for rejection and
4     notify the applicant by first class nonforwardable mail,
5     return postage guaranteed.
6         (2)  If the official registration application contains
7     the required information indicating that the applicant is
8     legally qualified to register as stated in the application,
9     the commission shall mail to the applicant a voter's
10     identification card in accordance with subsection (d)(1).
11         (3)  For an application for a transfer of registration or
12     a change in address or name, if the application contains the
13     required information and the applicant is legally qualified
14     to transfer registration or change name or address as stated
15     in the application, the commission shall make the transfer or
16     change. If the commission suspects that the applicant is not
17     entitled to transfer registration or to change name or
18     address, the commission may investigate. If the commission
19     finds that the applicant is not entitled to the transfer or
20     change, the application shall be rejected. The applicant
21     shall be notified of the rejection and the reason for it.
22     Rejection shall be made no later than ten days before the
23     election succeeding the filing of the application.
24     (c)  Result.--If an application is designed to serve as a
25  registration card, the accepted application of an elector may
26  serve as the elector's official registration card, if it was so
27  designed, and shall be filed in the office of the commission in
28  accordance with Chapter 7. If the application is not designed to
29  serve as a registration card, the information contained on the
30  application, including the elector's signature, shall be
1  transferred to the registration card. If a commission utilizes a
2  signature digitization list, it shall transfer all information
3  contained on the application, including the signature, to the
4  registry or, until the registry is established, to a computer
5  file. Applicants for registration shall be challenged under
6  section 529.
7     (d)  Disposition.--
8         (1)  When the registration of an elector has been finally
9     processed under subsection (b)(2), the commission shall
10     transmit to the applicant by first-class nonforwardable mail
11     a wallet-sized voter's identification card, which shall serve
12     as notice to the applicant of the disposition of the
13     application. The card shall contain all of the following:
14             (i)  Name and address of the elector.
15             (ii)  Name of municipality.
16             (iii)  Identification of elector's ward and district.
17             (iv)  Effective date of registration.
18             (v)  Designation of party enrollment and date of
19         enrollment.
20             (vi)  A space for the elector's signature or mark.
21             (vii)  A statement that the card relates only to the
22         time of issuance of the card and is not of itself
23         evidence or proof of the qualifications of the elector to
24         vote at an election or proof of identification for
25         purposes of applying for or receiving general assistance
26         and that it is not necessary to present the card when
27         voting. The statements required by this subparagraph
28         shall be placed on the reverse side of the card from
29         where all of the other information required by this
30         paragraph is placed.
1         (2)  The carrier envelope in which the identification
2     card is enclosed shall contain on the outside a request to
3     the postmaster to return it within five days if it cannot be
4     delivered to the addressee at the address given.
5         (3)  No registration application shall be deemed to be
6     accepted until ten days after the voter's identification card
7     has been mailed. Upon return by the post office of an
8     identification card under paragraph (2) which the post office
9     is unable to deliver at the given address, the commission
10     shall investigate. If the commission finds that the applicant
11     is not qualified to register from such address, the
12     commission shall reject the application of the applicant and
13     shall notify the applicant by first class forwardable mail of
14     this action.
15         (4)  If the applicant discloses that the elector's last
16     residence address upon registration was a location within
17     another county, the commission shall direct a cancellation
18     notice to the commission of that county. This cancellation
19     notice shall be in a form approved by the secretary in
20     substantially the following form:

16  Section 701.  General register.
17     (a)  Original registration cards.--If a commission uses the
18  original registration cards for registered electors in the
19  county as the district register, the duplicate registration
20  cards or photocopies of the original registration cards shall be
21  placed in exact alphabetical order by last name of the
22  registrant, shall be indexed and shall be kept at the office of
23  the registration commission in a manner as to be properly
24  safeguarded. These cards constitute the general register of the
25  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
26  commission except upon order of a court of record. Nothing in
27  this act shall preclude the use of duplicate registration cards
28  from applications provided under the act of March 30, 1937
29  (P.L.115, No.40), known as The First Class City Permanent
30  Registration Act, or the act of April 29, 1937 (P.L.487,

3  Third Class, Boroughs, Towns, and Townships.
4     (b)  Digitized signature lists.--If a commission uses
5  digitized signature lists as the district register, the original
6  registration cards shall be placed in exact alphabetical order
7  by last name of the registrant, indexed and kept at the office
8  of the commission in a manner as to be properly safeguarded.
9  These original cards constitute the general register of the
10  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
11  commission except upon order of a court of record. The
12  commission shall safely retain all registration cards used in
13  the registration of electors or in conducting an election. If a
14  commission has the capability to accept an electronic
15  application, the secretary may require the commission to produce
16  a computer-generated card to file in the general register. If
17  the commission finds a record for a registrant on the computer
18  data base which is not contained in the general register, it
19  shall replace the original card with a computer-generated
20  duplicate card upon written permission from the registrant or
21  upon order of a court of record.
22     (c)  Duplicate files.--If the commission deems a duplicate
23  file of registration cards necessary for administrative
24  purposes, the commission may prepare a reproduction in
25  compliance with the following:
26         (1)  The registration form shall be photographed,
27     microphotographed or reproduced in a manner approved for
28     permanent records by the secretary.

10         (2)  The cards constitute the district register.
11         (3)  The commission shall provide binders, which are
12     capable of being locked, for filing and indexing the
13     registration cards. The keys to the binders shall at all
14     times be retained by the commission.
15         (4)  The district register shall be kept at the office of
16     the commission, except as provided in subsection (b), and

20         (1)  Prior to full implementation of the Statewide
21     central registry under section 301, instead of using

24     computer-generated cards containing the registered electors
25     arranged by election district, alphabetically by last name of
26     the registrant.
27         (2)  After the full implementation of the Statewide
28     central registry under section 301, instead of using original
29     registration cards as the district register as provided in
30     subsection (a), a commission shall use a computer list or
1     computer-generated cards in a format as prescribed by the
2     secretary by regulation.
3         (3)  The computer list or computer-generated cards must
4     be in a form prescribed by the secretary and must contain
5     necessary information that would otherwise be available on
6     the registration cards, including a legible digitized

8     registration card. The district election officials shall have
9     computer printouts at the polling places containing the
10     necessary information needed to verify the identity of the
11     elector. The digitized signature list shall be open to public
12     inspection, subject to reasonable safeguards, rules and
13     regulations.

26             for each residence.
27             (ii)  The district register containing registration
28         cards shall be kept at the office of the commission and

1         provisions of this act.

20             address by forwardable mail and a postage prepaid

22             verify or correct the address information.
23                 (B)  If it appears from the information provided
24             through the United States Postal Service that an
25             elector has moved to a different residence address
26             outside the county, the commission shall use the
27             notice procedure described in clause (A).

7         (2)  In conjunction with, and not as an alternative to, a
8     program established under paragraph (1), a canvass may be
9     used as follows:
10             (i)  The registration commission may, by
11         commissioners or by inspectors of registration, verify
12         the registration in an election district by visiting the
13         building from which an elector is registered and other
14         buildings as the commission deems necessary.
15             (ii)  The commission shall make a record of the name
16         and address of each registered elector who is found not

19         registered election district.

29         of each such notice to be sent by mail promptly to such
30         person at the address from which he is registered. The
1         envelope containing such information is to be plainly
2         marked that it is not to be forwarded. At the expiration
3         of the time specified in the notice, the commission shall
4         cancel the registration of such person who has not
5         communicated with the commission and proved his
6         qualifications as an elector.
7             (iv)  To facilitate the canvass under this section,

10         double the number of election districts being canvassed.
11             (v)  Special inspectors must be qualified electors of

20     send a notice pursuant to subsection (d) to any elector who
21     has not voted nor appeared to vote during the period
22     beginning five years before the date of the notice and ending
23     on the date of the notice and for whom the board of elections
24     did not during that period in any other way receive any
25     information that the voter still resides in the registered
26     election district.
27         (4)  Commissions shall complete, not later than 90 days
28     before each primary, at least once per year the voter removal

6             the elector must return the card not later than 30
7             days prior to the next election. If the card is not
8             returned, affirmation or confirmation of the
9             elector's address may be required before the elector
