14  form:
15                             ARTICLE I
16                             MEMBERSHIP
17     Any State of the United States and the District of Columbia
1  may become a member of this agreement by enacting this

3                             ARTICLE II
4     RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE IN MEMBER STATES TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT
5                         AND VICE PRESIDENT
6     Each member state shall conduct a statewide popular election
7  for President and Vice President of the United States.
8                            ARTICLE III
9    MANNER OF APPOINTING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS IN MEMBER STATES
10     Prior to the time set by law for the meeting and voting by
11  the presidential electors, the chief election official of each
12  member state shall determine the number of votes for each
13  presidential slate in each State of the United States and in the
14  District of Columbia in which votes have been cast in a
15  statewide popular election and shall add such votes together to
16  produce a "national popular vote total" for each presidential
17  slate.
18     The chief election official of each member state shall
19  designate the presidential slate with the largest national
20  popular vote total as the "national popular vote winner."
21     The presidential elector certifying official of each member
22  state shall certify the appointment in that official's own state
23  of the elector slate nominated in that state in association with
24  the national popular vote winner.
25     At least six days before the day fixed by law for the meeting
26  and voting by the presidential electors, each member state shall
27  make a final determination of the number of popular votes cast
28  in the state for each presidential slate and shall communicate
29  an official statement of such determination within 24 hours to
30  the chief election official of each other member state.
1     The chief election official of each member state shall treat
2  as conclusive an official statement containing the number of
3  popular votes in a state for each presidential slate made by the
4  day established by Federal law for making a state's final
5  determination conclusive as to the counting of electoral votes
6  by Congress.
7     In event of a tie for the national popular vote winner, the
8  presidential elector certifying official of each member state
9  shall certify the appointment of the elector slate nominated in
10  association with the presidential slate receiving the largest
11  number of popular votes within that official's own state.
12     If, for any reason, the number of presidential electors
13  nominated in a member state in association with the national
14  popular vote winner is less than or greater than that state's
15  number of electoral votes, the presidential candidate on the
16  presidential slate that has been designated as the national
17  popular vote winner shall have the power to nominate the
18  presidential electors for that state and that state's
19  presidential elector certifying official shall certify the
20  appointment of such nominees.
21     The chief election official of each member state shall
22  immediately release to the public all vote counts or statements
23  of votes as they are determined or obtained.
24     This article shall govern the appointment of presidential
25  electors in each member state in any year in which this
26  agreement is, on July 20, in effect in states cumulatively
27  possessing a majority of the electoral votes.
28                             ARTICLE IV
29                          OTHER PROVISIONS
30     This agreement shall take effect when states cumulatively
1  possessing a majority of the electoral votes have enacted this
2  agreement in substantially the same form and the enactments by
3  such states have taken effect in each state.
4     Any member state may withdraw from this agreement, except
5  that a withdrawal occurring six months or less before the end of
6  a President's term shall not become effective until a President
7  or Vice President shall have been qualified to serve the next
8  term.
9     The chief executive of each member state shall promptly
10  notify the chief executive of all other states of when this
11  agreement has been enacted and has taken effect in that
12  official's state, when the state has withdrawn from this
13  agreement, and when this agreement takes effect generally.
14     This agreement shall terminate if the electoral college is
15  abolished.
16     If any provision of this agreement is held invalid, the
17  remaining provisions shall not be affected.
18                             ARTICLE V
