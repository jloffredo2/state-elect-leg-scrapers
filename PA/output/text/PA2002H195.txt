28  his residence on the day for holding the primary or election for
29  which the ballot was issued, or in the event any such elector
30  shall have recovered from his illness or physical disability
1  sufficiently to permit him to present himself at the proper
2  polling place for the purpose of casting his ballot, such
3  absentee ballot cast by such elector shall, be declared void.
4     Any such elector referred to in this subsection, who is
5  within the municipality of his residence, must present himself

7  presenting himself at his regular polling place in the same
8  manner as he could have voted had he not received an absentee
9  ballot: Provided, That such elector has first presented himself
10  to the judge of elections in his local election district and
11  shall have signed the affidavit on the absentee voter's
12  temporary registration card, which affidavit shall be in
13  substantially the following form:
14     I hereby swear that I am a qualified registered elector who
15  has obtained an absentee ballot, however, I am present in the
16  municipality of my residence and physically able to present
17  myself at my polling place and therefore request that my
18  absentee ballot be voided.

26  is in the district register, shall sign the aforementioned
27  affidavit in any case, which the local judge of elections shall
28  then cause to be inserted in the district register with the
29  elector's permanent registration card.
