10     Section 1302.2.  Approval of Application for Absentee
11  Ballot.--
12     (a) The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
13  application filed by a qualified elector not required to be
14  registered under preceding section 1301, shall ascertain from
15  the information on such application, district register or from
16  any other source that such applicant possesses all the
17  qualifications of a qualified elector other than being
18  registered or enrolled. If the board is satisfied that the
19  applicant is qualified to receive an official absentee ballot,
20  the application shall be marked approved such approval decision
21  shall be final and binding except that challenges may be made
22  only on the ground that the applicant did not possess
23  qualifications of an absentee elector. Such challenges must be
24  made to the county board of elections prior to 5:00 o'clock P.
25  M. on the first [Friday] Monday prior to the election. When so
26  approved, the county board of elections shall cause the
27  applicant's name and residence (and at a primary, the party
28  enrollment) to be inserted in the Military, Veterans and
29  Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters File as provided in section
30  1302.3, subsection (b): Providing, however, That no application
1  of any qualified elector in military service shall be rejected
2  for failure to include on his application any information if
3  such information may be ascertained within a reasonable time by
4  the county board of elections.
5     (b) The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
6  application filed by a qualified elector who is entitled, under
7  the provisions of the Permanent Registration Law as now or
8  hereinafter enacted by the General Assembly, to absentee
9  registration prior to or concurrently with the time of voting as
10  provided under preceding section 1301, shall ascertain from the
11  information on such application or from any other source that
12  such applicant possesses all the qualifications of a qualified
13  elector. If the board is satisfied that the applicant is
14  entitled, under the provisions of the Permanent Registration Law
15  as now or hereinafter enacted by the General Assembly, to
16  absentee registration prior to or concurrently with the time of
17  voting and that the applicant is qualified to receive an
18  official absentee ballot, the application shall be marked
19  "approved." Such approval decision shall be final and binding
20  except that challenges may be made only on the ground that the
21  applicant did not possess the qualifications of an absentee
22  elector prior to or concurrently with the time of voting. Such
23  challenges must be made to the county board of elections prior
24  to 5:00 o'clock P. M. on the first [Friday] Monday prior to the
25  election. When so approved, the county board of elections shall
26  cause the applicant's name and residence (and at a primary, the
27  party enrollment) to be inserted in the Military, Veterans and
28  Emergency Civilian Absentee Voters File as provided in section
29  1302.3 subsection (b).
30     (c) The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
1  application of a qualified elector required to be registered
2  under the provisions of preceding section 1301, shall determine
3  the qualifications of such applicant by comparing the
4  information set forth on such application with the information
5  contained on the applicant's permanent registration card. If the
6  board is satisfied that the applicant is qualified to receive an
7  official absentee ballot, the application shall be marked
8  "approved." Such approval decision shall be final and binding,
9  except that challenges may be made only on the ground that the
10  applicant did not possess the qualifications of an absentee
11  elector. Such challenges must be made to the county board of
12  elections prior to 5:00 o'clock P. M. on the first Friday prior
13  to the election. When so approved, the registration commission
14  shall cause an absentee voter's temporary registration card to
15  be inserted in the district register on top of and along with
16  the permanent registration card. The absentee voter's temporary
17  registration card shall be in the color and form prescribed in
18  subsection (e) of this section:
19     Provided, however, That the duties of the county boards of
20  elections and the registration commissions with respect to the
21  insertion of the absentee voter's temporary registration card of
22  any elector from the district register as set forth in section
23  1302.2 shall include only such applications and emergency
24  applications as are received on or before the first Tuesday
25  prior to the primary or election. In all cases where
26  applications are received after the first Tuesday prior to the
27  primary or election and before five o'clock P. M. on the first
28  [Friday] Monday prior to the primary or election, the county
29  board of elections shall determine the qualifications of such
30  applicant by comparing the information set forth on such
1  application with the information contained on the applicant's
2  duplicate registration card on file in the General Register
3  (also referred to as the Master File) in the office of the
4  Registration Commission and shall cause the name and residence
5  (and at primaries, the party enrollment) to be inserted in the
6  Military, Veterans and Emergency Civilian Absentee Voters File
7  as provided in section 1302.3, subsection (b). In addition, the
8  local district boards of elections shall, upon canvassing the
9  official absentee ballots under section 1308, examine the voting
10  check list of the election district of said elector's residence
11  and satisfy itself that such elector did not cast any ballot
12  other than the one properly issued to him under his absentee
13  ballot application. In all cases where the examination of the
14  local district board of elections discloses that an elector did
15  vote a ballot other than the one properly issued to him under
16  the absentee ballot application, the local district board of
17  elections shall thereupon cancel said absentee ballot and said
18  elector shall be subject to the penalties as hereinafter set
19  forth.
20     (d) In the event that any application for an official
21  absentee ballot is not approved by the county board of
22  elections, the elector shall be notified immediately to that
23  effect with a statement by the county board of the reasons for
24  the disapproval.
25     (e) The absentee voter's temporary registration card shall be
26  in duplicate and the same size as the permanent registration
27  card, in a different and contrasting color to the permanent
28  registration card and shall contain the absentee voter's name
29  and address and shall conspicuously contain the words "Absentee
30  Voter." Such card shall also contain the affidavit required by
1  subsection (b) of section 1306.
2     Section 1306.  Voting by Absentee Electors.--(a) At any time
3  after receiving an official absentee ballot, but on or before
4  five o'clock P. M. on the [Friday] Monday prior to the primary
5  or election, the elector shall, in secret, proceed to mark the
6  ballot only in black lead pencil, indelible pencil or blue,
7  black or blue-black ink, in fountain pen or ball point pen, and
8  then fold the ballot, enclose and securely seal the same in the
9  envelope on which is printed, stamped or endorsed "Official
10  Absentee Ballot." This envelope shall then be placed in the
11  second one, on which is printed the form of declaration of the
12  elector, and the address of the elector's county board of
13  election and the local election district of the elector. The
14  elector shall then fill out, date and sign the declaration
15  printed on such envelope. Such envelope shall then be securely
16  sealed and the elector shall send same by mail, postage prepaid,
17  except where franked, or deliver it in person to said county
18  board of election:
19     Provided, however, That any elector, spouse of the elector or
20  dependent of the elector, qualified in accordance with the
21  provisions of section 1301, subsections (e), (f), (g) and (h) to
22  vote by absentee ballot as herein provided, shall be required to
23  include on the form of declaration a supporting declaration in
24  form prescribed by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, to be
25  signed by the head of the department or chief of division or
26  bureau in which the elector is employed, setting forth the
27  identity of the elector, spouse of the elector or dependent of
28  the elector:
29     Provided further, That any elector who has filed his
30  application in accordance with section 1302 subsection (e) (2),
1  and is unable to sign his declaration because of illness or
2  physical disability, shall be excused from signing upon making a
3  declaration which shall be witnessed by one adult person in
4  substantially the following form: I hereby declare that I am
5  unable to sign my declaration for voting my absentee ballot
6  without assistance because I am unable to write by reason of my
7  illness or physical disability. I have made or received
8  assistance in making my mark in lieu of my signature.

14  ...................................
15     (Complete Address of Witness)
16     (b) In the event that any such elector, excepting an elector
17  in military service or any elector unable to go to his polling
18  place because of illness or physical disability, entitled to
19  vote an official absentee ballot shall be in the county of his
20  residence on the day for holding the primary or election for
21  which the ballot was issued, or in the event any such elector
22  shall have recovered from his illness or physical disability
23  sufficiently to permit him to present himself at the proper
24  polling place for the purpose of casting his ballot, such
25  absentee ballot cast by such elector shall, be declared void.
26     Any such elector referred to in this subsection, who is
27  within the county of his residence must present himself at his
28  polling place and, shall be permitted to vote upon presenting
29  himself at his regular polling place in the same manner as he
30  could have voted had he not received an absentee ballot:
1  Provided, That such elector has first presented himself to the
2  judge of elections in his local election district and shall have
3  signed the affidavit on the absentee voter's temporary
4  registration card, which affidavit shall be in substantially the
5  following form:
6     I hereby swear that I am a qualified registered elector who
7  has obtained an absentee ballot, however, I am present in the
8  county of my residence and physically able to present myself at
9  my polling place and therefore request that my absentee ballot
10  be voided.

14       (Local Judge of Elections)
15     An elector who has received an absentee ballot under the
16  emergency application provisions of section 1302.1, and for
17  whom, therefore, no temporary absentee voter's registration card
18  is in the district register, shall sign the aforementioned
19  affidavit in any case, which the local judge of elections shall
20  then cause to be inserted in the district register with the
21  elector's permanent registration card.
22     Section 2.  Section 1308 of the act, amended or added
23  December 11, 1968 (P.L.1183, No.375) or July 11, 1980 (P.L.600,
24  No.128), is amended to read:
25     Section 1308.  Canvassing of Official Absentee Ballots.--
26     (a)  The county boards of election, upon receipt of official
27  absentee ballots in such envelopes, shall safely keep the same
28  in sealed or locked containers until they distribute same to the
29  appropriate local election districts in a manner prescribed by
30  the Secretary of the Commonwealth.
1     The county board of elections shall then distribute the
2  absentee ballots, unopened, to the absentee voter's respective
3  election district concurrently with the distribution of the
4  other election supplies. Absentee ballots shall be canvassed
5  immediately and continuously without interruption until
6  completed after the close of the polls on the day of the
7  election in each election district. The results of the canvass
8  of the absentee ballots shall then be included in and returned
9  to the county board with the returns of that district. No
10  absentee ballot shall be counted which is received in the office
11  of the county board of election later than five o'clock P. M. on
12  the [Friday] Monday immediately preceding the primary or
13  November election.
14     (b)  Watchers shall be permitted to be present when the
15  envelopes containing official absentee ballots are opened and
16  when such ballots are counted and recorded.
17     (b.1)  (1)  In the event that an electronic voting system
18  provides for central tabulations of ballots, such absentee
19  ballots shall be opened and deposited in the ballot box without
20  being counted except as to the number of absentee ballots cast.
21  The absentee ballots shall be counted along with the other
22  ballots from the election district at the location and in the
23  manner specified by the county board of elections and provided
24  for by the electronic voting system utilized.
25     (2)  In the event that an electronic voting system provides
26  for tabulation of votes at the election district, such absentee
27  ballots shall be opened, checked for write-in votes in
28  accordance with section 1113-A and then either hand-counted or
29  counted by means of the automatic tabulation equipment, whatever
30  the case may be.
1     (d)  Whenever it shall appear by due proof that any absentee
2  elector who has returned his ballot in accordance with the
3  provisions of this act has died prior to the opening of the
4  polls on the day of the primary or election, the ballot of such
5  deceased elector shall be rejected by the canvassers but the
6  counting of the ballot of an elector thus deceased shall not of
7  itself invalidate any nomination or election.
8     (e)  At such time the local election board shall then further
9  examine the declaration on each envelope not so set aside and
10  shall compare the information thereon with that contained in the
11  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and
12  the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters
13  File." If the local election board is satisfied that the
14  declaration is sufficient and the information contained in the
15  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and
16  the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters
17  File" verifies his right to vote, the local election board shall
18  announce the name of the elector and shall give any watcher
19  present an opportunity to challenge any absentee elector upon
20  the ground or grounds (1) that the absentee elector is not a
21  qualified elector; or (2) that the absentee elector was within
22  the county of his residence on the day of the primary or
23  election during the period the polls were open, except where he
24  was in military service or except in the case where his ballot
25  was obtained for the reason that he was unable to appear
26  personally at the polling place because of illness or physical
27  disability; or (3) that the absentee elector was able to appear
28  personally at the polling place on the day of the primary or
29  election during the period the polls were open in the case his
30  ballot was obtained for the reason that he was unable to appear
1  personally at the polling place because of illness or physical
2  disability. Upon challenge of any absentee elector, as set forth
3  herein the local election board shall mark "challenged" on the
4  envelope together with the reason or reasons therefor, and the
5  same shall be set aside for return to the county board unopened
6  pending decision by the county board and shall not be counted.
7  All absentee ballots not challenged for any of the reasons
8  provided herein shall be counted and included with the general
9  return of paper ballots or voting machines, as the case may be
10  as follows. Thereupon, the local election board shall open the
11  envelope of every unchallenged absentee elector in such manner
12  as not to destroy the declaration executed thereon. All of such
13  envelopes on which are printed, stamped or endorsed the words
14  "Official Absentee Ballot" shall be placed in one or more
15  depositories at one time and said depository or depositories
16  well shaken and the envelopes mixed before any envelope is taken
17  therefrom. If any of these envelopes shall contain any
18  extraneous marks or identifying symbols other than the words
19  "Official Absentee Ballot," the envelopes and the ballots
20  contained therein shall be set aside and declared void. The
21  local election board shall then break the seals of such
22  envelopes, remove the ballots and record the votes in the same
23  manner as district election officers are required to record
24  votes. With respect to the challenged ballots, they shall be
25  returned to the county board with the returns of the local
26  election district where they shall be placed unopened in a
27  secure, safe and sealed container in the custody of the county
28  board until it shall fix a time and place for a formal hearing
29  of all such challenges and notice shall be given where possible
30  to all absentee electors thus challenged and to every attorney,
1  watcher or candidate who made such challenge. The time for the
2  hearing shall not be later than seven (7) days after the date of
3  said challenge. On the day fixed for said hearing, the county
4  board shall proceed without delay to hear said challenges and,
5  in hearing the testimony, the county board shall not be bound by
6  technical rules of evidence. The testimony presented shall be
7  stenographically recorded and made part of the record of the
8  hearing. The decision of the county board in upholding or
9  dismissing any challenge may be reviewed by the court of common
10  pleas of the county upon a petition filed by any person
11  aggrieved by the decision of the county board. Such appeal shall
12  be taken, within two (2) days after such decision shall have
13  been made, whether reduced to writing or not, to the court of
14  common pleas setting forth the objections to the county board's
15  decision and praying for an order reversing same. Pending the
16  final determination of all appeals, the county board shall
17  suspend any action in canvassing and computing all challenged
18  ballots irrespective of whether or not appeal was taken from the
19  county board's decision. Upon completion of the computation of
20  the returns of the county, the votes cast upon the challenged
21  official absentee ballots shall be added to the other votes cast
22  within the county.
23     (f)  Any person challenging an application for an absentee
24  ballot or an absentee ballot for any of the reasons provided in
25  this act shall deposit the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) in cash
26  with the local election board, in cases of challenges made to
27  the local election board and with the county board in cases of
28  challenges made to the county board for which he shall be issued
29  a receipt for each challenge made, which sum shall only be
30  refunded if the challenge is sustained or if the challenge is
1  withdrawn within five (5) days after the primary or election. If
2  the challenge is dismissed by any lawful order then the deposit
3  shall be forfeited. All deposit money received by the local
4  election board shall be turned over to the county board
5  simultaneously with the return of the challenged ballots. The
6  county board shall deposit all deposit money in the general fund
7  of the county.
8     Notice of the requirements of subsection (b) of section 1306
9  shall be printed on the envelope for the absentee ballot.
10     Section 3.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
