1  office of the county board of elections not earlier than fifty
2  (50) days before the primary or election and not later than five
3  o'clock P.M. of the first Tuesday prior to the day of any
4  primary or election.[: Provided, however, That]
5     (b)  Except as provided in subsection (c), in the event any
6  elector otherwise qualified who is so physically disabled or ill
7  on or before the first Tuesday prior to any primary or election
8  that he is unable to file his application or who becomes
9  physically disabled or ill after the first Tuesday prior to any
10  primary or election and is unable to appear at his polling place
11  or any elector otherwise qualified who because of the conduct of
12  his business, duties or occupation will necessarily be absent
13  from the municipality of his residence on the day of the primary
14  or election, which fact was not and could not reasonably be
15  known to said elector on or before the first Tuesday prior to
16  any primary or election, the elector shall be entitled to an
17  absentee ballot at any time prior to five o'clock P.M. on the
18  first Friday preceding any primary or election upon execution of
19  an Emergency Application in such form prescribed by the
20  Secretary of the Commonwealth.
21     (c)  In the event any elector otherwise qualified who becomes
22  so physically disabled or ill between five o'clock P.M. on the
23  first Friday preceding any primary or election and eight o'clock
24  P.M. on the day of any primary or election that he is unable to
25  appear at his polling place or any elector otherwise qualified
26  who because of the conduct of his business, duties or occupation

28  residence on the day of the primary or election, which fact was
29  not and could not reasonably be known to said elector prior to
30  five o'clock P.M. on the first Friday preceding any primary or
1  election, the elector shall be entitled to an absentee ballot if
2  the elector completes and files with the court of common pleas
3  in the county in which the elector is qualified to vote an
4  Emergency Application or a letter or other signed document,
5  which includes the same information as is provided on the

16  person rendering assistance shall be identified either by court
17  order or in records of the county as a person authorized to
18  provide voting assistance. The person, or a deputy sheriff,
19  shall declare in writing that assistance was rendered. If no
20  declaration is filed and another person witnesses a person
21  rendering voting assistance, the person rendering assistance has
22  committed a violation of this act. If the elector is unable to
23  appear in court to receive the ballot, the judge shall give the
24  elector's absentee ballot to an authorized representative of the
25  elector. The authorized representative shall deliver the
26  absentee ballot to the elector and return the completed absentee
27  ballot, sealed in the official absentee ballot envelopes, to the
28  county board of elections, who shall distribute the ballot,
29  unopened, to the absentee voter's election district. If the
30  elector is unable to appear in court or unable to obtain
1  assistance from an authorized representative, the judge shall
2  direct a deputy sheriff of the county to deliver the absentee
3  ballot to the elector if the elector is at a physical location
4  within the county and return the completed absentee ballot,
5  sealed in the official absentee ballot envelopes, to the county
6  board of elections who shall distribute the ballots unopened to
7  the absentee voter's respective election district. If a deputy
8  sheriff is unavailable to deliver an absentee ballot under this
9  section, the judge shall direct a constable or an employe or
10  official of the county board of elections to make such delivery,
11  in accordance with the provisions of this section. No absentee
12  ballot under this subsection shall be counted which is received
13  in the office of the county board of elections later than eight
14  o'clock P.M. on the day of the primary or election.
15     (d)  In the case of an elector who is physically disabled or
16  ill on or before the first Tuesday prior to a primary or
17  election or becomes physically disabled or ill after the first
18  Tuesday prior to a primary or election, such Emergency
19  Application, letter or other signed document shall contain a
20  supporting affidavit from his attending physician stating that
21  due to physical disability or illness said elector was unable to
22  apply for an absentee ballot on or before the first Tuesday
23  prior to the primary or election or became physically disabled
24  or ill after that period.
25     (e)  In the case of an elector who is necessarily absent
26  because of the conduct of his business, duties or occupation
27  under the unforeseen circumstances specified in [this
28  subsection] subsections (b) and (c), such Emergency Application,
29  letter or other signed document shall contain a supporting
30  affidavit from such elector stating that because of the conduct
1  of his business, duties or occupation said elector will
2  necessarily be absent from the municipality of his residence on
3  the day of the primary or election which fact was not and could
4  not reasonably be known to said elector on or before the first
5  Tuesday prior to the primary or election.

22  elector who has returned his ballot in accordance with the
23  provisions of this act has died prior to the opening of the
24  polls on the day of the primary or election, the ballot of such
25  deceased elector shall be rejected by the canvassers but the

30  shall compare the information thereon with that contained in the
1  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and

5  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and
6  the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters
7  File" verifies his right to vote, the local election board shall
8  announce the name of the elector and shall give any watcher
9  present an opportunity to challenge any absentee elector upon
10  the ground or grounds (1) that the absentee elector is not a
11  qualified elector; or (2) that the absentee elector was within
12  the municipality of his residence on the day of the primary or
13  election during the period the polls were open, except where he
14  was in military service or except in the case where his ballot
15  was obtained for the reason that he was unable to appear
16  personally at the polling place because of illness or physical
17  disability; or (3) that the absentee elector was able to appear
18  personally at the polling place on the day of the primary or
19  election during the period the polls were open in the case his
20  ballot was obtained for the reason that he was unable to appear
21  personally at the polling place because of illness or physical
22  disability. Upon challenge of any absentee elector, as set forth
23  herein the local election board shall mark "challenged" on the
24  envelope together with the reason or reasons therefor, and the
25  same shall be set aside for return to the county board unopened
26  pending decision by the county board and shall not be counted.
27  All absentee ballots not challenged for any of the reasons
28  provided herein shall be counted and included with the general
29  return of paper ballots or voting machines, as the case may be
30  as follows. Thereupon, the local election board shall open the
1  envelope of every unchallenged absentee elector in such manner
2  as not to destroy the declaration executed thereon. All of such
3  envelopes on which are printed, stamped or endorsed the words
4  "Official Absentee Ballot" shall be placed in one or more
5  depositories at one time and said depository or depositories
6  well shaken and the envelopes mixed before any envelope is taken
7  therefrom. If any of these envelopes shall contain any
8  extraneous marks or identifying symbols other than the words
9  "Official Absentee Ballot," the envelopes and the ballots
10  contained therein shall be set aside and declared void. The
11  local election board shall then break the seals of such
12  envelopes, remove the ballots and record the votes in the same
13  manner as district election officers are required to record
14  votes. With respect to the challenged ballots, they shall be
15  returned to the county board with the returns of the local
16  election district where they shall be placed unopened in a
17  secure, safe and sealed container in the custody of the county
18  board until it shall fix a time and place for a formal hearing
19  of all such challenges and notice shall be given where possible
20  to all absentee electors thus challenged and to every attorney,
21  watcher or candidate who made such challenge. The time for the
22  hearing shall not be later than seven (7) days after the date of
23  said challenge. On the day fixed for said hearing, the county
24  board shall proceed without delay to hear said challenges and,
25  in hearing the testimony, the county board shall not be bound by
26  technical rules of evidence. The testimony presented shall be
27  stenographically recorded and made part of the record of the
