24  County of ................., State of Pennsylvania ............
25  Election held on the ..... day of .........., 19.. A cross (X)
26  or check ( ) mark in the square opposite the name of any
27  candidate indicates a vote for that candidate.
28     To vote a straight party ticket, mark a cross (X) or check
29  ( ) in the square, in the Party Column, opposite the name of the
30  party of your choice. To vote for an individual candidate of
1  another party after making a mark in the party square, mark a
2  cross (X) or check ( ) opposite his name. For an office where
3  more than one candidate is to be voted for, the voter, after
4  marking in the party square, may divide his vote by marking a
5  cross (X) or check ( ) to the right of each candidate for whom
6  he or she desires to vote. For such office votes shall not be
7  counted for candidates not individually marked.
8     To vote for a person whose name is not on the ballot, write,
9  print or paste his name in the blank space provided for that
10  purpose. To indicate support for none of the candidates listed
11  for an office, mark a cross (X) or check ( ) opposite the
12  statement " none of the above" where it appears. A cross (X) or
13  check ( ) mark in the square opposite the names of the
14  candidates of any party for President and Vice-President of the
15  United States indicates a vote for all the candidates of that
16  party for presidential elector. To vote for individual
17  candidates for presidential elector, write, print or paste their
18  names in the blank spaces provided for that purpose under the
19  title "Presidential Electors." Mark ballot only in black lead
20  pencil, indelible pencil or blue, black or blue-black ink, in
21  fountain pen or ball point pen; use the same pencil or pen for
22  all markings you place on the ballot.
23     Before leaving the voting compartment, fold this ballot,
24  without displaying the markings thereon, in the same way it was
25  folded when received, then leave the compartment and exhibit the
26  ballot to one of the election officers who shall ascertain by an
27  inspection of the number appearing upon the right hand corner of
28  the back of the ballot whether the ballot so exhibited to him is
29  the same ballot which the elector received before entering the
30  voting compartment. If it is the same, the election officer
1  shall direct the elector, without unfolding the ballot, to
2  remove the perforated corner containing the number, and the
3  elector shall immediately deposit the ballot in the ballot box.
4  Any ballot deposited in a ballot box at any primary or election
5  without having the said number torn off shall be void and shall
6  not be counted.

14  1959 (P.L.2142, No.790), is amended and the section is amended
15  by adding a subsection to read:
16     Section 1215.  Method of Marking Ballots and Depositing Same
17  in Districts in Which Ballots are Used.--* * *
18     (c) At elections, the elector shall prepare his ballot in the
19  following manner: He may vote for the candidates of his choice
20  for each office to be filled according to the number of persons
21  to be voted for by him for each office, by making a cross (X) or
22  check ( ) mark in the square opposite the name of the candidate,
23  or he may insert by writing, stamping or sticker, in the blank
24  spaces provided therefor, any name not already printed on the
25  ballot, and such insertion shall count as a vote without the
26  making of a cross (X) or check ( ) mark[.], or he may vote
27  against all of the candidates listed for an office set forth in
28  subsection (e), by making a cross (X) or check ( ) mark in the
29  square opposite the statement "none of the above" where it
30  appears. If he desires to vote for every candidate of a
1  political party or political body, except its candidates for
2  offices as to which he votes for individual candidates in the
3  manner hereinafter provided, he may make a cross (X) or check (
4  ) mark in the square opposite the name of the party or political
5  body of his choice in the party column on the left of the
6  ballot, and every such cross (X) or check ( ) mark shall be
7  equivalent to and be counted as a vote for every candidate of a
8  party or political body so marked, including its candidates for
9  presidential electors, except for those offices as to which he
10  has indicated a choice for individual candidates of the same or
11  another party or political body, by making a cross (X) or check
12  ( ) mark opposite their names in the manner hereinabove
13  provided, as to which offices his ballot shall be counted only
14  for the candidates which he has thus individually marked,
15  notwithstanding the fact that he made a mark in the party
16  column, and even though in the case of an office for which more
17  than one candidate is to be voted for, he has not individually
18  marked for such office the full number of candidates for which
19  he is entitled to vote. If he desires to vote for the entire
20  group of presidential electors nominated by any party or
21  political body, he may make a cross (X) or check
22  ( ) mark in the appropriate square at the right of the names of
23  the candidates for President and Vice-President of such party or
24  body. If he desires to vote a ticket for presidential electors
25  made up of the names of persons nominated by different parties
26  or political bodies, or partially of names of persons so in
27  nomination and partially of names of persons not in nomination
28  by any party or political body, or wholly of names of persons
29  not in nomination by any party or political body, he shall
30  insert the names of the candidates for presidential electors for
1  whom he desires to vote in the blank spaces provided therefor
2  under the title of the office "Presidential Electors." In case
3  of a question submitted to the vote of the electors, he may make
4  a cross (X) or check ( ) mark in the appropriate square opposite
5  the answer which he desires to give.

11  General Assembly.

17     (d) At primaries, he shall vote for each candidate
18  individually by operating the key, handle, pointer or knob, upon
19  or adjacent to which the name of such candidate is placed. At
20  elections, he may vote for each candidate individually by
21  operating the key, handle, pointer or knob, upon or adjacent to
22  which the names of candidates of his choice are placed, or he
23  may vote a straight political party ticket in one operation by
24  operating the straight political party lever of the political
25  party or political body of his choice, if such machine has
26  thereon a separate lever for all the candidates of the political
27  body. He may also, after having operated the straight party
28  lever, and before recording his vote, cancel the vote for any
29  candidate of such political party or political body by replacing
30  the individual key, handle, pointer or knob of such candidate,
1  and may thereupon vote for a candidate of another party, or
2  political body for the same office by operating the key, handle,
3  pointer or knob, upon or adjacent to which the name of such
4  candidate appears. The elector may, at any primary or election,
5  indicate his support for none of the candidates listed for an
6  office set forth in subsection (h) by operating the key, handle,
7  pointer or knob, upon or adjacent to which the statement "none
8  of the above" is placed. In the case of a question submitted to
9  the vote of the electors, the elector shall operate the key,
10  handle, pointer or knob corresponding to the answer which he
11  desires to give.
12     * * *

29  election for President of the United States, United States
30  Senator, Governor, Attorney General, Auditor General, Treasurer,
1  Representative in Congress, or Senator or Representative in the
2  General Assembly, if the category of "none of the above"

5  election to any candidate for that office, but shall schedule a
6  special election to be held in the appropriate voting districts
7  at least sixty days after certification of the election returns.
8  Any special election required by this section shall be conducted
9  in accordance with section 1229 of this act. None of the
10  unsuccessful candidates in the initial election shall be
11  eligible to become a candidate in a subsequent special election
12  required by this section.
13     Section 1420.  Certification of Returns; Votes Cast for "None
14  of the Above."--Except as provided in section 1419 of this act,
15  any vote or votes cast for "none of the above," in accordance
16  with sections 1215 and 1216 of this act, shall be canvassed,
17  certified, computed, counted, recanvassed, recorded, tabulated,
18  tallied and otherwise treated as any vote or votes cast for a
19  candidate is canvassed, certified, computed, counted,
