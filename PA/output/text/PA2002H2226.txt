10         required by this act. Data uploaded to the SURE system
11         must be in the format required by the department and must
12         include all data elements from the registrant's voter
13         registration application and the digitized signature of
14         the registrant. Each county participating in the SURE
15         system in accordance with this subparagraph shall upload
16         voter registration records daily according to a schedule
17         established by the secretary. The county data base shall
18         constitute the general register for all counties that
19         connect to the SURE system pursuant to this section. A
20         county selecting this alternative must have its
21         electronic interface approved by the department prior to
22         connecting to the SURE system to insure that information
23         is being delivered to the department and received by the
24         county in the format required by the SURE system. The
25         electronic interface shall be bidirectional to be used
26         for the daily exchange of registration records and
27         digitized signature files between the SURE data base and
28         the commission's system in the format able to be read by
29         both the county and the SURE system. The development and
30         cost of this portion of the electronic interface shall be
1         shared equally by the department and the respective
2         county. Any county selecting this option which does not
3         at the time of notifying the department in accordance
4         with subsection (d) utilize signature digitization must
5         have contracted for digitized signature conversion and
6         begun such conversion within one year of filing the
7         notification required in subsection (d).
8             (ii)  If the SURE system is upgraded in such a way
9         that makes the county interface inoperable the State
10         shall pay for any costs to update the interface. If any
11         county subsequently decides to upgrade its hardware or
12         software in such a way that makes the interface
13         inoperable, the county shall pay for any costs to update
14         the interface.
15     (d)  Timetable.--The timetable for implementation of the SURE
16  system shall be established by the secretary but in no case
17  shall be later than three years after the effective date of this
18  act unless otherwise approved by the General Assembly. The
19  secretary may phase in the use of the system on a county-by-
20  county basis, provided, however, that no county shall use the
21  registry for any purpose authorized by this act until the
22  secretary shall certify that all proper tests have been
23  conducted insuring that the system as established in the county
24  is capable of performing according to all requirements of this
25  act and that the conversion interfaces accurately convert the
26  county registration record and digitized signature files to the
27  SURE format. The commission of each county shall select the
28  alternatives specified in subsection (c) for use in their county
29  and notify the secretary within 30 days of the effective date of
30  this act which option they have selected. Once a commission has
1  selected participation under subsection (c)(1), it may not
2  change the option it has selected. A commission that has
3  selected the option in subsection (c)(2) may at a later date
4  request a change to the option in subsection (c)(1).
5     (e)  Advisory board.--The secretary shall appoint an advisory
6  board to assist the department in developing and implementing
7  the SURE system composed of one representative of the County
8  Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania and one representative
9  of a commission of each class county of the Commonwealth. All
10  meetings of the board shall be recorded and shall be open to the
11  public.

12         Federal or State employee, the individual's registration
13         shall be canceled under Chapter 9.

18         commission shall forward the registrant's registration
19         [card] record from the general register and original
20         record to the commission of the registrant's new county

2         change of address notification shall mail a notice to the
3         registrant at the new residence address requesting
4         verification of the address change. If the change of
5         address is to a new residence outside the commission's
6         jurisdiction, the commission shall mail the following
7         notice:
8         Date................

13         that you recently changed your address from
14         ................. (old residence address) to
15         ............... (new residence address) and that this
16         change of address is to serve as a change of address for
17         voter registration purposes. Unless you notify this
18         office within ten days from the date of this notice that
19         this information is not correct, your voter registration
20         will be transferred to ........... County. You may notify
21         this office by writing your residence address, the date

27         If the address change is within the commission's
28         jurisdiction, the county shall mail a voter's
29         identification card to the registrant at the new
30         residence address.
1             (iii)  If the registrant does not return the notice
2         under subparagraph (ii) within the ten-day period, the
3         commission shall process the change of address according
4         to subparagraph (i). If the registrant notifies the
5         commission that the information is incorrect and the
6         commission is satisfied with the registrant's explanation
7         of the discrepancy, the address of the registrant's
8         registration shall remain unchanged. If the verification
9         notification or voter identification card is returned by
10         the post office as undeliverable as addressed or with a
11         forwarding address, the commission shall send a
12         confirmation notice to the registrant's address of former
13         residence in accordance with section 1901(d)(2).

28  Section 528.  Approval of registration applications.
29     * * *
30     (b)  Decision.--
1         (1)  If the commission finds the official registration
2     application not properly completed, the application shall be
3     rejected. The commission should make reasonable efforts to
4     complete the registration before rejecting it for omissions
5     and inconsistencies. If the commission rejects an application
6     under this paragraph, it shall indicate "REJECTED" on the
7     application and state there the reason for rejection and
8     notify the applicant by first class nonforwardable mail,
9     return postage guaranteed. A record of a rejected
10     registration application filed electronically shall be
11     preserved on the registry. Registration applications
12     originating on paper shall be retained in accordance with the
13     provisions of this act.
14         (2)  If the official registration application contains
15     the required information indicating that the applicant is
16     legally qualified to register as stated in the application,
17     the commission shall mail to the applicant a voter's
18     identification card in accordance with subsection (d)(1).
19         (3)  For an application for a transfer of registration or

21     required information and the applicant is legally qualified
22     to transfer registration or change name or address as stated
23     in the application, the commission shall make the transfer or
24     change. If the commission suspects that the applicant is not
25     entitled to transfer registration or to change name or
26     address, the commission may investigate. If the commission
27     finds that the applicant is not entitled to the transfer or
28     change, the application shall be rejected. The applicant
29     shall be notified of the rejection and the reason for it.
30     Rejection shall be made no later than ten days before the
1     election succeeding the filing of the application.
2     (c)  Result.--[If an] Until such time as the commission is
3  able to use the SURE system for the administration of voter
4  registration pursuant to this act, if a voter registration
5  application is designed to serve as a registration card, the
6  accepted application of an elector may serve as the elector's
7  official registration card, if it was so designed, and shall be
8  filed in the office of the commission in accordance with Chapter
9  7. If the application is not designed to serve as a registration
10  card, the information contained on the application, including
11  the elector's signature, shall be transferred to the
12  registration card. If a commission utilizes a signature
13  digitization list, it shall transfer all information contained
14  on the application, including the signature, to the registry or,
15  until the registry is established, to a computer file. Once the
16  commission is connected to the registry, the information
17  contained on an approved voter registration application,
18  including the elector's signature, shall be transferred to the
19  registry. If the approved application has been submitted
20  electronically, the commission shall make it a permanent record
21  of the registry and print a paper copy and process it according
22  to section 702(b)(1). Applicants for registration shall be
23  challenged under section 529. For purposes of this subsection a
24  registration card shall be a card containing all information
25  required on the registration application, including the
26  elector's signature, and suitable space for the insertion by the
27  appropriate official of the following information:
28         (1)  The ward and election district of residence.
29         (2)  The registrant's street address.
30         (3)  Data required to be given upon removal from the
1     registrant's residence.
2         (4)  The date of each election at which the registrant
3     votes.
4         (5)  The number and letter of the stub of the ballot
5     issued to the registrant or the registrant's number in the
6     order of admission to the voting machines.
7         (6)  The initials of the election officer who enters the
8     record of voting in the district register.

13     (a)  [Original registration] Registration cards.--[If] Before
14  a commission is connected to the SURE system, if a commission
15  uses the original registration cards for registered electors in
16  the county as the district register, the duplicate registration
17  cards or photocopies of the original registration cards shall be
18  placed in exact alphabetical order by last name of the
19  registrant, shall be indexed and shall be kept at the office of
20  the registration commission in a manner as to be properly
21  safeguarded. These cards constitute the general register of the
22  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
23  commission except upon order of a court of record. Nothing in
24  this act shall preclude the use of duplicate registration cards
25  from applications provided under the act of March 30, 1937
26  (P.L.115, No.40), known as The First Class City Permanent
27  Registration Act, or the act of April 29, 1937 (P.L.487,

29  the Second Class, Cities of the Second Class A, Cities of the
30  Third Class, Boroughs, Towns, and Townships.
1     (b)  Digitized signature lists.--[If] Before a commission is
2  connected to the SURE system, if a commission uses digitized
3  signature lists as the district register, the original
4  registration cards shall be placed in exact alphabetical order
5  by last name of the registrant, indexed and kept at the office
6  of the commission in a manner as to be properly safeguarded.
7  These original cards constitute the general register of the
8  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
9  commission except upon order of a court of record. The
10  commission shall safely retain all registration cards used in
11  the registration of electors or in conducting an election. If a
12  commission has the capability to accept an electronic
13  application, the secretary may require the commission to produce
14  a computer-generated card to file in the general register. If
15  the commission finds a record for a registrant on the computer
16  data base which is not contained in the general register, it
17  shall replace the original card with a computer-generated
18  duplicate card upon written permission from the registrant or
19  upon order of a court of record.
20     (c)  Duplicate files.--[If] Before a commission is connected
21  to the SURE system, if the commission deems a duplicate file of
22  registration cards necessary for administrative purposes, the
23  commission may prepare a reproduction in compliance with the
24  following:
25         (1)  The registration form shall be photographed,
26     microphotographed or reproduced in a manner approved for
27     permanent records by the secretary.
28         (2)  The device used to reproduce the card is one which
29     accurately reproduces the original in all details.
30         (3)  The photographs, microphotographs or other
1     reproductions are open to public inspection and provision is
2     made for preserving, examining and using them.
3     (d)  General rule after connection.--After connection to the
4  SURE system, the data base of registrants appropriate to the
5  county maintained on the SURE system or the county data
6  processing facilities as selected by each commission in
7  accordance with section 322(c) shall constitute the general
8  register of the county and shall be used by the commission for
9  preparation of the district register. The data base for each
10  registrant shall contain all information of the registrant
11  required on the registration application, including his or her
12  signature, and suitable space for the insertion by the
13  appropriate official of the ward and election district of
14  residence, the registrant's street address, data required to be
15  given upon removal from the registrant's residence, the date of
16  each election at which the registrant votes, whether the
17  registrant is a Federal or State employee, an indication whether
18  the registrant needs assistance to vote and, if so, the nature
19  of the disability, and a unique identifier for all registrants
20  established by the secretary, except that identifying numbers
21  currently used by the counties shall also be maintained on the

28     1973gg et seq.).
29     (b)  Voter removal program.--
30         (1)  The [commission] secretary shall establish [a] the
1     following program to identify electors whose address may have
2     changed by establishing one of the following programs:
3             (i)  National change of address. The secretary shall
4         establish by regulation a program whereby information
5         supplied by the United States Postal Service through its
6         licensees is used on a periodic basis, but not less than
7         once every calendar year, to identify electors who may
8         have changed addresses. [The information shall be
9         incorporated in the SURE system and shall be forwarded to
10         the commissions in a manner determined by the secretary
11         by regulation.] The secretary shall purchase the
12         information from a licensee in accordance with
13         contracting procedures. The secretary shall conduct the
14         comparative search of names on the list against the SURE
15         data base and notify each county via the SURE system of
16         the change of address information including the date of
17         removal for those electors who should receive a notice
18         according to this section. The secretary shall be
19         responsible for covering all costs associated with the
20         national change of address program. Commissions that
21         maintain their county data base as the general register
22         pursuant to section 322(c)(2) may, at the county's
23         option, conduct the national change of address program
24         locally by contracting with a licensed vendor at county
25         expense.
26                 (A)  If it appears from the information provided
27             through the United States Postal Service that an
28             elector has moved to a different residence address
29             within the same county as the elector is currently
30             registered, the commission shall change the
1             registration records to show the new address and
2             shall send the elector, to the address recorded on
3             the elector's registration, a notice of the change of
4             address by forwardable mail and a postage prepaid,
5             preaddressed return form by which the elector may
6             verify or correct the address information.
7                 (B)  If it appears from the information provided
8             through the United States Postal Service that an
9             elector has moved to a different residence address
10             outside the county, the commission shall use the
11             notice procedure described in clause (A).
12             (ii)  Confirmation mailing:
13                 (A)  [A] In addition to using the program
14             specified in subparagraph (i), a commission may
15             establish a program by sending a direct,
16             nonforwardable first class "return if undeliverable -
17             address correction requested" mailing to all
18             registered electors in the county not marked inactive
19             in accordance with subsection (c).
20                 (B)  If this program is established, the
21             commission shall use the notice procedure described
22             in subparagraph (i)(A) and (B) for any elector whose
23             mailing is returned undeliverable.
24         (2)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
25     program established under paragraph (1), a canvass may be
26     used as follows:
27             (i)  The registration commission may, by
28         commissioners or by inspectors of registration, verify
29         the registration in an election district by visiting the
30         building from which an elector is registered and other
1         buildings as the commission deems necessary.
2             (ii)  The commission shall make a record of the name
3         and address of each registered elector who is found not
4         to reside at the registered address or who for any other
5         reason appears to be not qualified to vote in the
6         registered election district.
7             (iii)  The commission shall leave at the address of
8         each person referred to in subparagraph (ii) a notice
9         requiring him to communicate with the commission on or
10         before a date which the commission shall designate, and
11         which shall be not less than seven days and not more than
12         15 days from the date of the notice and in any case not
13         later than the 15th day preceding the election next
14         ensuing, and satisfy the commission of his qualifications
15         as an elector. The commission shall cause a confirmation
16         of each such notice to be sent by mail promptly to such
17         person at the address from which he is registered. The
18         envelope containing such information is to be plainly
19         marked that it is not to be forwarded. At the expiration
20         of the time specified in the notice, the commission shall
21         cancel the registration of such person who has not
22         communicated with the commission and proved his
23         qualifications as an elector.
24             (iv)  To facilitate the canvass under this section,
25         the commission may, when necessary, appoint special
26         inspectors of registration, in number not exceeding
27         double the number of election districts being canvassed.
28             (v)  Special inspectors must be qualified electors of
29         the county. They shall be appointed without reference to
30         residence in election districts or to political
1         affiliations or beliefs. The commission shall instruct
2         special inspectors in their duties. Special inspectors
3         have the powers conferred by this act upon inspectors of
4         registration.
5         (3)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
6     program established under paragraph (1), the commission shall
7     send a notice pursuant to subsection (d) to any elector who
8     has not voted nor appeared to vote during the period
9     beginning five years before the date of the notice and ending
10     on the date of the notice and for whom the board of elections
11     did not during that period in any other way receive any
12     information that the voter still resides in the registered
13     election district.
14         (4)  Commissions shall complete, not later than 90 days
15     before each [primary] election, at least once per year the
16     voter removal programs under this section and shall promptly
17     update information contained in its registration records.
18     This paragraph shall not be construed to preclude any of the
19     following:
20             (i)  Cancellation of an elector's registration as
21         provided for under subsection (a)(1) or (2).
22             (ii)  Correction of registration records in
23         accordance with this act.
24     (c)  Identification of inactive voters.--A commission shall
25  mark an "I" or "inactive" on the registration [card] record of
26  each elector who has been mailed a form under subsection (b)(1)
27  or (3) and has failed to respond[, which]. The registration
28  record of each registered elector classified as inactive shall
29  be included with all other registration [cards] records for that
30  polling site and located at the individual's polling site on the
1  day of the election but may be contained on a list separate from
2  electors not marked inactive.
3     (d)  Cancellation of registration.--
4         (1)  A commission shall not cancel the registration of an
5     elector on the ground that the elector has changed residence

14             necessary, corrected the commission's record of the
15             elector's address, in an election during the period
16             beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the

21     acceptable if it is a postage prepaid and preaddressed return
22     card, sent by forwardable mail, on which the elector may
23     state the elector's current address, if it contains a notice
24     as follows:

28             the elector must return the card not later than 30
29             days prior to the next election. If the card is not
30             returned, affirmation or confirmation of the
