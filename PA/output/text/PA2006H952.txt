8     (a)  Department of Health.--A commission shall immediately

10  the Department of Health. The Department of Health shall[,
11  within 60 days of receiving notice of the death of an individual
12  18 years of age or older, send the] report to the registration
13  commission within 30 days of the last day of each calendar month
14  the deaths of residents of such counties, except residents under
15  18 years of age, for that month. Such report shall include the
1  full name and last address of residence of that individual [to a
2  commission], the date of his birth, if available, and the date
3  of death in a manner and on a form prescribed by the department.
4  The commission shall promptly update information contained in
5  its registration records to reflect the death of the registered
6  elector and the cancellation of his registration.
7     (b)  Other sources.--A commission may also utilize published
8  newspaper obituaries, letters testamentary or letters of
9  administration issued by the office of the registrar of wills to
10  cancel and remove the registration of an elector, provided that
11  such removals are uniform, nondiscriminatory and in compliance
12  with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Public Law 89-110, 42 U.S.C.
13  ยง 1973 et seq.). The commission shall promptly update
14  information contained in its registration records.
15     (c)  Corrections.--An individual incorrectly reported
16  deceased by the Department of Health or incorrectly removed by a
17  commission for reason of death may appear in person before a
18  commissioner, registrar or clerk at the office of the commission
19  and prove identity. The commission, upon such proof, shall
20  correct its registration records.
21     (d)  Removal of commissioners for nonfeasance.--In the event
22  the Bureau of Commissions, Elections and Legislation determines
23  that the registration commission of any county has failed to
24  timely cancel the registration of any person reported to it as
25  deceased by the Department of Health, such failure shall
26  constitute nonfeasance in office and upon notification to the
27  registration commission each commissioner shall be deemed as
28  removed from office immediately. The president judge of the
29  court of common pleas shall fill each vacancy by appointing a
30  judge or an elector of the county to serve as an interim
1  registration commissioner for the remainder of the term.
2     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
