17  (P.L.178, No.45), is amended to read:
18     Section 1210.  Manner of Applying to Vote; Persons Entitled
19  to Vote; Voter's Certificates; Entries to Be Made in District
20  Register; Numbered Lists of Voters; Challenges.--(a)  At every
21  primary and election each elector [who appears to vote in that
1  election district for the first time and] who desires to vote
2  shall first present to an election officer a voter's
3  identification card issued by the county registration commission
4  or any one of the following forms of photo identification:
5     (1)  a valid driver's license or identification card issued
6  by the Department of Transportation;
7     (2)  a valid identification card issued by any other agency
8  of the Commonwealth;
9     (3)  a valid identification card issued by the United States
10  Government;
11     (4)  a valid United States passport;
12     (5)  a valid student identification card;
13     (6)  a valid employe identification card; or
14     (7)  a valid armed forces of the United States identification
15  card.
16  The election officer shall examine the identification presented
17  by the elector and sign an affidavit stating that this has been
18  done.
19     (a.1)  [Where the elector does not have a photo
20  identification as provided for in subsection (a), the elector
21  shall present for examination one of the following forms of
22  identification that shows the name and address of the elector:
23     (1)  nonphoto identification issued by the Commonwealth, or
24  any agency thereof;
25     (2)  nonphoto identification issued by the United States
26  Government, or agency thereof;
27     (3)  a firearm permit;
28     (4)  a current utility bill;
29     (5)  a current bank statement;
30     (6)  a paycheck;
1     (7)  a government check.
2  The election officer shall examine the identification presented
3  by the elector and sign an affidavit stating that this has been
4  done.
5     (a.2)  If the elector is unable to produce identification or
6  the elector's identification is challenged by the judge of
7  elections, the elector shall be permitted to cast a provisional
8  ballot in accordance with subsection (a.4).]
9     (a.3)  All electors[, including any elector that shows
10  identification pursuant to subsection (a),] shall subsequently
11  sign a voter's certificate in blue, black or blue-black ink with
12  a fountain pen or ball point pen, and, unless he is a State or
13  Federal employe who has registered under any registration act
14  without declaring his residence by street and number, he shall
15  insert his address therein, and hand the same to the election
16  officer in charge of the district register. Such election
17  officer shall thereupon announce the elector's name so that it
18  may be heard by all members of the election board and by all
19  watchers present in the polling place and shall compare the
20  elector's signature on his voter's certificate with his
21  signature in the district register. If, upon such comparison,
22  the signature upon the voter's certificate appears to be
23  genuine, the elector who has signed the certificate shall, if
24  otherwise qualified, be permitted to vote: Provided, That if the
25  signature on the voter's certificate, as compared with the
26  signature as recorded in the district register, shall not be
27  deemed authentic by any of the election officers, such elector
28  shall not be denied the right to vote for that reason, but shall
29  be considered challenged as to identity and required to make the
30  affidavit and produce the evidence as provided in subsection (d)
1  of this section. When an elector has been found entitled to
2  vote, the election officer who examined his voter's certificate
3  and compared his signature shall sign his name or initials on
4  the voter's certificate, shall, if the elector's signature is
5  not readily legible, print such elector's name over his
6  signature, and the number of the stub of the ballot issued to
7  him or his number in the order of admission to the voting
8  machines, and at primaries a letter or abbreviation designating
9  the party in whose primary he votes shall also be entered by one
10  of the election officers or clerks. As each voter is found to be
11  qualified and votes, the election officer in charge of the
12  district register shall write or stamp the date of the election
13  or primary, the number of the stub of the ballot issued to him
14  or his number in the order of admission to the voting machines,
15  and at primaries a letter or abbreviation designating the party
16  in whose primary he votes, and shall sign his name or initials
17  in the proper space on the registration card of such voter
18  contained in the district register.
19     As each voter votes, his name in the order of voting shall be
20  recorded in two (2) numbered lists of voters provided for that
21  purpose, with the addition of a note of each voter's party
22  enrollment after his name at primaries.
23     (a.4)  (1)  At all elections an individual who claims to be
24  properly registered and eligible to vote at the election
25  district but whose name does not appear on the district register
26  and whose registration cannot be determined by the inspectors of
27  election or the county election board shall be permitted to cast
28  a provisional ballot. Individuals who are voting for the first
29  time at the election district shall be required to produce
30  identification pursuant to subsection (a) or (a.1) and if unable
1  to do so shall be permitted to cast a provisional ballot. An
2  individual presenting a judicial order to vote shall be
3  permitted to cast a provisional ballot.
4     (2)  Prior to voting the provisional ballot, the elector
5  shall be required to sign an affidavit stating the following:
6                I do solemnly swear or affirm that my
7  name is _____________, that my date of birth is ___________,
8  and at the time that I registered I resided at _______________in
9  the municipality of ______________ in _____________ County of
10  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and that this is the only
11  ballot that I cast in this election.
12  Signature of Voter/Elector
13  Current Address
14  Check the Reason for Casting the Provisional Ballot.
15  Signed by Judge of Elections and minority inspector
16     (3)  After the provisional ballot has been cast, the
17  individual shall place it in a secrecy envelope. The individual
18  shall place the secrecy envelope in the provisional ballot
19  envelope and shall place his signature on the front of the
20  provisional ballot envelope. All provisional ballots shall
21  remain sealed in their provisional ballot envelopes for return
22  to the county board of elections.
23     (4)  Within seven calendar days of the election, the county
24  board of elections shall examine each provisional ballot
25  envelope that is received to determine if the individual voting
26  that ballot was entitled to vote at the election district in the
27  election. One authorized representative of each candidate in an
28  election and one representative from each political party shall
29  be permitted to remain in the room in which the determination is
30  being made. Representatives shall be permitted to keep a list of
1  those persons who cast a provisional ballot and shall be
2  entitled to challenge any determination of the county board of
3  elections with respect to the counting or partial counting of
4  the ballot under this section. Upon challenge of any provisional
5  ballot under this clause, the ballot envelope shall be marked
6  "challenged" together with the reason for the challenge, and the
7  provisional ballot shall be set aside pending final
8  determination of the challenge according to the following
9  procedure:
10     (i)  Provisional ballots marked "challenged" shall be placed
11  unopened in a secure, safe and sealed container in the custody
12  of the county board of elections until it shall fix a time and
13  place for a formal hearing of all such challenges, and notice
14  shall be given where possible to all provisional electors thus
15  challenged and to every attorney, watcher or candidate who made
16  the challenge.
17     (ii)  The time for the hearing shall not be later than seven
18  days after the date of the challenge.
19     (iii)  On the day fixed for the hearing, the county board
20  shall proceed without delay to hear the challenges and, in
21  hearing the testimony, the county board shall not be bound by
22  the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence.
23     (iv)  The testimony presented shall be stenographically
24  recorded and made part of the record of the hearing.
25     (v)  The decision of the county board in upholding or
26  dismissing any challenge may be reviewed by the court of common
27  pleas of the county upon a petition filed by any petitioner
28  aggrieved by the decision of the county board. The appeal shall
29  be taken, within two days after the decision was made, whether
30  the decision was reduced to writing or not, to the court of
1  common pleas setting forth the objections to the county board's
2  decision and praying for an order reversing the decision.
3     (vi)  Pending the final determination of all appeals, the
4  county board shall suspend any action in canvassing and
5  computing all challenged provisional ballots irrespective of
6  whether or not an appeal was taken from the county board's
7  decision.
8     (vii)  Upon completion of the computation of the returns of
9  the county, the votes cast upon the challenged official
10  provisional ballots shall be added to the other votes cast
11  within the county.
12     (5)  (i)  Except as provided in subclause (ii), if it is
13  determined that the individual was registered and entitled to
14  vote at the election district where the ballot was cast, the
15  county board of elections shall compare the signature on the
16  provisional ballot envelope with the signature on the elector's
17  registration form and, if the signatures are determined to be
18  genuine, shall count the ballot if the county board of elections
19  confirms that the individual did not cast any other ballot,
20  including an absentee ballot, in the election.
21     (ii)  A provisional ballot shall not be counted if:
22     (A)  either the provisional ballot envelope under clause (3)
23  or the affidavit under clause (2) is not signed by the
24  individual;
25     (B)  the signature required under clause (3) and the
26  signature required under clause (2) are either not genuine or
27  are not executed by the same individual; or
28     (C)  a provisional ballot envelope does not contain a secrecy
29  envelope.
30     (iii)  One authorized representative of each candidate in an
1  election and one representative from each party shall be
2  permitted to remain in the room in which deliberation or
3  determination of subclause (ii) is being made.
4     (6)  If it is determined that the individual voting the
5  provisional ballot was not registered, the provisional ballot
6  shall not be counted and the ballot shall remain in the
7  provisional ballot envelope and shall be marked "Rejected as
8  Ineligible."
9     (7)  The following shall apply:
10     (i)  Except as provided in subclause (ii), if it is
11  determined that the individual voting the provisional ballot was
12  eligible to vote in the county in which the ballot was cast but
13  not at the election district where the ballot was cast, the
14  county board of elections shall open the envelope and only count
15  that portion of the ballot that the individual would have been
16  eligible to vote in his proper election district and at the
17  election district where the vote was cast if:
18     (A)  the county board of elections confirms that the
19  individual did not cast any other ballot, including an absentee
20  ballot, in the election; and
21     (B)  the individual casting the provisional ballot is a
22  resident of the county in which the provisional ballot was cast.
23     (ii)  In the event that the individual casting the
24  provisional ballot is not found to be a resident of the county
25  in which the provisional ballot was cast, the ballot shall not
26  be counted.
27     (iii)  In the event that the board of elections determines,
28  based on an evidentiary record, that the individual
29  intentionally and wilfully cast a provisional ballot in an
30  election district in which the individual was not eligible to
1  vote, the ballot shall not be counted.
2     (8)  On election night, immediately upon completion of the
3  count and tabulation of the votes cast, the judge of election
4  shall prepare and certify under oath a tally displaying the
5  number of provisional ballots received from the election board
6  and the number of provisional ballots cast and transmitted to
7  the county board of elections. The judge of election shall
8  record on the tabulation the name of the individual into whose
9  possession the provisional ballots were passed for transmission
10  to the county board of elections.
11     (9)  All provisional ballots and the tally of provisional
12  ballots tabulated under clause (8) in the possession of an
13  election board official shall be promptly returned by the judge
14  of election to the custody of the proper county election board
15  in accordance with sections 1113-A(j), 1225(b) and 1228(a).
16     (10)  One authorized representative of each candidate in an
17  election and one representative from each political party shall
18  be permitted to remain in the room where provisional ballots are
19  received by the county board of elections.
20     (11)  The department shall establish a World Wide Web site
21  and a toll-free telephone number to permit an individual who
22  cast a provisional ballot to determine whether the vote of that
23  individual was counted and, if the vote was not counted, the
24  reason that it was not counted.
25     (12)  For purposes of this subsection, "provisional ballot"
26  means a ballot issued to an individual who claims to be a
27  registered elector by the judge of elections on election day
28  when the individual's name does not appear on the general
29  register and the individual's registration cannot be verified.
30     (b)  If any elector was unable to sign his name at the time
1  of registration, or, if having been able to sign his name when
2  registered, he subsequently shall have lost his sight or lost
3  the hand with which he was accustomed to sign his name, or shall
4  have been otherwise rendered by disease or accident unable to
5  sign his name when he applies to vote, he shall establish his
6  identity to the satisfaction of the election officers, and in
7  such case he shall not be required to sign a voter's
8  certificate, but a certificate shall be prepared for him by one
9  of the election officers, upon which the facts as to such
10  disability shall be noted and attested by the signature of such
11  election officer.
12     (c)  No person who applies to vote shall be permitted by any
13  election officer or clerk or other person to see the signature
14  recorded as his in the district register until after he shall
15  have signed his name to the voter's certificate.
16     (d)  No person, except a qualified elector who is in actual
17  military or naval service under a requisition of the President
18  of the United States or by the authority of this Commonwealth,
19  and who votes under the provisions of Article XIII of this act,
20  shall be entitled or permitted to vote at any primary or
21  election at any polling place outside the election district in
22  which he resides, nor shall he be permitted to vote in the
23  election district in which he resides, unless he has been
24  personally registered as an elector and his registration card
25  appears in the district register of such election district,
26  except by order of the court of common pleas as provided in this
27  act, and any person, although personally registered as an
28  elector, may be challenged by any qualified elector, election
29  officer, overseer, or watcher at any primary or election as to
30  his identity, as to his continued residence in the election
1  district or as to any alleged violation of the provisions of
2  section 1210 of this act, and if challenged as to identity or
3  residence, he shall produce at least one qualified elector of
4  the election district as a witness, who shall make affidavit of
5  his identity or continued residence in the election district:
6  Provided, however, That no person shall be entitled to vote as a
7  member of a party at any primary, unless he is registered and
8  enrolled as a member of such party upon the district register,
9  which enrollment shall be conclusive as to his party membership
10  and shall not be subject to challenge on the day of the primary.
11     (e)  A person who wilfully commits fraud or who conspires to
12  wilfully commit fraud in relation to any of the provisions of
13  this section commits a felony of the third degree and, upon
14  conviction, shall be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding
15  fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) or to undergo a term of
16  imprisonment of not more than seven years, or both. An
17  individual convicted under this subsection shall be barred for
18  life from serving as a judge, inspector or clerk of election,
19  machine inspector translator, county election board official,
20  poll watcher or in any other official capacity relating to the
