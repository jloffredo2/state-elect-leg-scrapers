14  within the periods limited by this act shall be deemed to be
15  valid, unless, within seven days after the last day for filing
16  said nomination petition or paper, a petition is presented to
17  the court specifically setting forth the objections thereto, and
18  praying that the said petition or paper be set aside. A copy of
19  said petition shall, within said period, be served on the

24  petition or paper, and specifying the time and manner of notice

29  over other business before it, and shall finally determine said
30  matter not later than fifteen (15) days after the last day for

4  number of genuine signatures of electors entitled to sign the
5  same under the provisions of this act, or was not filed by
6  persons entitled to file the same, it shall be set aside. If the
7  objections relate to material errors or defects apparent on the
8  face of the nomination petition or paper, the court, after
9  hearing, may, in its discretion, permit amendments within such
10  time and upon such terms as to payment of costs, as the said
11  court may specify. In case any such petition is dismissed, the
12  court shall make such order as to the payment of the costs of
13  the proceedings, including witness fees, as it shall deem just.
14  Appeals of decisions on objection cases must be filed within two
15  (2) business days of the filing of such a decision. In the event
16  of an appeal, the court from which the appeal is taken shall
17  transmit the record to the appellate court as soon as
18  practicable. If a person shall sign any nomination petitions or
19  papers for a greater number of candidates than he is permitted
20  under the provisions of this act, if said signatures bear the
21  same date, they shall, upon objections filed thereto, not be
22  counted on any petition or paper and if they bear different
23  dates, they shall be counted in the order of their priority of
24  date, for only so many persons as there are candidates to be
25  nominated or elected. The office of the Prothonotary of the
26  Commonwealth Court and the office of the Secretary of the
27  Commonwealth and the various offices of prothonotary of the
28  court of common pleas shall be open between the hours of eight-

25  ballot, which number shall likewise appear on the official
26  absentee ballot for the qualified elector. The numbers shall

28  are distributed the number on the ballot shall be torn off by
29  the county board of election. This number information shall be
30  appropriately inserted and become a part of the Registered
1  Absentee Voters File and the Military, Veterans and Emergency
2  Civilian Absentee Voters File provided in section 1302.3 of this
3  act.

7  ballot pursuant to section 1301 and who, on election day, is

9  absentee ballot and vote in the normal manner at the appropriate
10  voting place. Such forms shall be made freely available to the

15  of any qualified elector in military service shall be rejected

24  provided under preceding section 1301, shall ascertain from the
25  information on such application or from any other source that
26  such applicant possesses all the qualifications of a qualified
27  elector. If the board is satisfied that the applicant is
28  entitled[, under the provisions of the Permanent Registration
29  Law as now or hereinafter enacted by the General Assembly,] to

15     (c)  The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
16  application of a qualified elector required to be registered
17  under the provisions of preceding section 1301, shall determine
18  the qualifications of such applicant by comparing the

20  contained on the applicant's permanent registration card. If the
21  board is satisfied that the applicant is qualified to receive an
22  official absentee ballot, the application shall be marked
23  "approved." Such approval decision shall be final and binding,

26  elector. Such challenges must be made to the county board of
27  elections prior to 5:00 o'clock P. M. on the first Friday prior
28  to the election. When so approved, the registration commission

7  any elector from the district register as set forth in section
8  1302.2 shall include only such applications and emergency
9  applications as are received on or before the first Tuesday

11  applications are received after the first Tuesday prior to the
12  primary or election and before five o'clock P. M. on the first
13  Friday prior to the primary or election, the county board of
14  elections shall determine the qualifications of such applicant
15  by comparing the information set forth on such application with

17  registration card on file in the General Register (also referred
18  to as the Master File) in the office of the Registration
19  Commission and shall cause the name and residence (and at
20  primaries, the party enrollment) to be inserted in the Military,
21  Veterans and Emergency Civilian Absentee Voters File as provided

23  district boards of elections shall, upon canvassing the official
24  absentee ballots under section 1308, examine the voting check
25  list of the election district of said elector's residence and
26  satisfy itself that such elector did not cast any ballot other
27  than the one properly issued to him under his absentee ballot
28  application. In all cases where the examination of the local
29  district board of elections discloses that an elector did vote a
30  ballot other than the one properly issued to him under the
1  absentee ballot application, the local district board of
2  elections shall thereupon cancel said absentee ballot and said

18  comply with the forty-five day delivery or mailing requirement
19  of this section, then the county board of elections shall mail
20  absentee ballots or special write-in absentee ballots within
21  five days of the county board's receipt of the information

9  election for any office by submitting a Federal Write-In
10  Absentee Ballot prescribed by the Uniformed and Overseas
11  Citizens Absentee Voting Act (Public Law 99-410, 100 Stat. 924).
12  The submission and processing of a Federal Write-In Absentee
13  Ballot shall be governed by section 103 of the Uniformed and
14  Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act or its successor and this
15  act.
16     (b)  In the event that any such elector, excepting an elector
17  in military service or any elector unable to go to his polling
18  place because of illness or physical disability, entitled to
19  vote an official absentee ballot shall be in the municipality of

6     I hereby swear that I am a qualified registered elector who

9  myself at my polling place and therefore request that my
10  absentee ballot be voided.

14       (Local Judge of Elections)
15     An elector who has received an absentee ballot under the
16  emergency application provisions of section 1302.1, and for
17  whom, therefore, no temporary absentee voter's registration card
18  is in the district register, shall sign the aforementioned
19  affidavit in any case, which the local judge of elections shall

21  elector's permanent registration card.
22     Section 8.  Section 1308 of the act, amended December 11,
23  1968 (P.L.1183, No.375), February 13, 1998 (P.L.72, No.18) and
24  December 9, 2002 (P.L.1246, No.150), is amended to read:
25     Section 1308.  Canvassing of Official Absentee Ballots.--
26     (a)  The county boards of election, upon receipt of official
27  absentee ballots in [such] official envelopes, shall safely keep
28  the same in sealed or locked containers until they distribute
29  same to the appropriate local election districts in a manner
30  prescribed by the Secretary of the Commonwealth.
1     The county board of elections shall then distribute the
2  absentee ballots, unopened, to the absentee voter's respective
3  election district concurrently with the distribution of the
4  other election supplies. Absentee ballots shall be canvassed
5  immediately and continuously without interruption until
6  completed after the close of the polls on the day of the
7  election in each election district. The results of the canvass
8  of the absentee ballots shall then be included in and returned
9  to the county board with the returns of that district. No
10  absentee ballot shall be counted which is received in the office
11  of the county board of election later than five o'clock P. M. on
12  the Friday immediately preceding the primary or November
13  election[.], except that the ballots received from electors
14  qualified in accordance with section 1301(a), (b), (c), (d),
15  (e), (f), (g) and (h) shall be canvassed if received by eight
16  o'clock P. M. on the day of the election or by the seventh day
17  following the election if such absentee ballot carries a
18  postmark dated no later than the day before the election.
19     (a.1)  Absentee ballots received from electors qualified in
20  accordance with section 1301(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g)
21  and (h) after the duplicate list was prepared and distributed to
22  the local election boards in accordance with section 1302.3(b.1)
23  and (c) but up until eight o'clock P. M. the day of the primary
24  or election ballots shall be canvassed at the official canvass
25  required for each election as required by section 1403. In all
26  cases where absentee ballots are received after the duplicate
27  list was prepared and distributed to the local election boards
28  in accordance with section 1302.3(b.1) but up until eight
29  o'clock P. M. the day of the primary or election, the county
30  board of elections shall examine the voting check list of the
1  election district of said elector's residence and satisfy itself
2  that such elector did not cast any ballot other than the one
3  properly issued to him under his absentee ballot application. In
4  all cases where such examination discloses that an elector did
5  vote a ballot other than the one properly issued to him under
6  the absentee ballot application, the board of elections shall
7  thereupon cancel said absentee ballot and said elector shall be
8  subject to the penalties as set forth in this act.
9     (b)  Each candidate for nomination or election shall be
10  entitled to appoint one watcher and each political party or body
11  which has nominated candidates shall be entitled to appoint two
12  watchers to be present at each canvass of absentee ballots.
13  Watchers shall be permitted to be present when the envelopes
14  containing official absentee ballots are opened and when such
15  ballots are counted and recorded.
16     (b.1)  In all election districts in which electronic voting
17  systems are used, absentee ballots shall be opened at the
18  election district, checked for write-in votes in accordance with
19  section 1113-A and then either hand-counted or counted by means
20  of the automatic tabulation equipment, whatever the case may be.
21     (d)  Whenever it shall appear by due proof that any absentee
22  elector who has returned his ballot in accordance with the
23  provisions of this act has died prior to the opening of the
24  polls on the day of the primary or election, the ballot of such
25  deceased elector shall be rejected by the canvassers but the
26  counting of the ballot of an elector thus deceased shall not of
27  itself invalidate any nomination or election.
28     (e)  At such time the local election board shall then further
29  examine the declaration on each envelope not so set aside and
30  shall compare the information thereon with that contained in the
1  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and
2  the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters
3  File." If the local election board is satisfied that the
4  declaration is sufficient and the information contained in the
5  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and
6  the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters
7  File" verifies his right to vote, the local election board shall
8  announce the name of the elector and shall give any watcher
9  present an opportunity to challenge any absentee elector upon
10  the ground or grounds (1) that the absentee elector is not a
11  qualified elector; or (2) that the absentee elector was within
12  the municipality of his residence on the day of the primary or
13  election during the period the polls were open, except where he
14  was in military service or except in the case where his ballot
15  was obtained for the reason that he was unable to appear
16  personally at the polling place because of illness or physical
17  disability; or (3) that the absentee elector was able to appear
18  personally at the polling place on the day of the primary or
19  election during the period the polls were open in the case his
20  ballot was obtained for the reason that he was unable to appear
21  personally at the polling place because of illness or physical
22  disability. Upon challenge of any absentee elector, as set forth
23  herein the local election board shall mark "challenged" on the
24  envelope together with the reason or reasons therefor, and the
25  same shall be set aside for return to the county board unopened
26  pending decision by the county board and shall not be counted.
27  All absentee ballots not challenged for any of the reasons
28  provided herein shall be counted and included with the general
29  return of paper ballots or voting machines, as the case may be
30  as follows. Thereupon, the local election board shall open the
1  envelope of every unchallenged absentee elector in such manner
2  as not to destroy the declaration executed thereon. All of such
3  envelopes on which are printed, stamped or endorsed the words
4  "Official Absentee Ballot" shall be placed in one or more
5  depositories at one time and said depository or depositories
6  well shaken and the envelopes mixed before any envelope is taken
7  therefrom. If any of these envelopes shall contain any
8  extraneous marks or identifying symbols other than the words
9  "Official Absentee Ballot," the envelopes and the ballots
10  contained therein shall be set aside and declared void. The
11  local election board shall then break the seals of such
12  envelopes, remove the ballots and record the votes in the same
13  manner as district election officers are required to record
14  votes. With respect to the challenged ballots, they shall be
15  returned to the county board with the returns of the local
16  election district where they shall be placed unopened in a
17  secure, safe and sealed container in the custody of the county
18  board until it shall fix a time and place for a formal hearing
19  of all such challenges and notice shall be given where possible
20  to all absentee electors thus challenged and to every attorney,
21  watcher or candidate who made such challenge. The time for the
22  hearing shall not be later than seven (7) days after the date of
23  said challenge. On the day fixed for said hearing, the county
24  board shall proceed without delay to hear said challenges and,
25  in hearing the testimony, the county board shall not be bound by
26  technical rules of evidence. The testimony presented shall be
27  stenographically recorded and made part of the record of the
28  hearing. The decision of the county board in upholding or
29  dismissing any challenge may be reviewed by the court of common
30  pleas of the county upon a petition filed by any person
1  aggrieved by the decision of the county board. Such appeal shall
2  be taken, within two (2) days after such decision shall have
3  been made, whether reduced to writing or not, to the court of
4  common pleas setting forth the objections to the county board's
5  decision and praying for an order reversing same. Pending the
6  final determination of all appeals, the county board shall
7  suspend any action in canvassing and computing all challenged
8  ballots irrespective of whether or not appeal was taken from the
9  county board's decision. Upon completion of the computation of
10  the returns of the county, the votes cast upon the challenged
11  official absentee ballots shall be added to the other votes cast
12  within the county.
13     (e.1)  Absentee ballots cast by electors qualified in
14  accordance with section 1301(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g)
15  and (h) and received after the canvass required by subsection
16  (a) but by the seventh day following the election which are
17  postmarked no later than the day before the election shall be
18  canvassed in a separate canvass to occur no later than eight (8)
19  days after the election to be conducted in accordance with the
20  procedures required by this section for the first canvass of
21  absentee ballots. Such absentee ballots shall be subject to the
22  challenge procedures specified in subsection (e). The board
23  shall add the results for the second canvass to the totals of
24  the first canvass by election district.
25     (f)  Any person challenging an application for an absentee
26  ballot or an absentee ballot for any of the reasons provided in
27  this act shall deposit the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) in cash
28  with the local election board, in cases of challenges made to
29  the local election board and with the county board in cases of
30  challenges made to the county board for which he shall be issued
1  a receipt for each challenge made, which sum shall only be
2  refunded if the challenge is sustained or if the challenge is
3  withdrawn within [five (5) days] ten (10) days after the primary
4  or election. If the challenge is dismissed by any lawful order
5  then the deposit shall be forfeited. All deposit money received
6  by the local election board shall be turned over to the county
7  board simultaneously with the return of the challenged ballots.
8  The county board shall deposit all deposit money in the general
9  fund of the county.
10     Notice of the requirements of subsection (b) of section 1306
11  shall be printed on the envelope for the absentee ballot.

13  (P.L.707, No.379), is amended to read:
14     Section 1309.  Public Records.--All official absentee

18  and shall be safely kept for a period of two years, except that
19  no information concerning a military elector shall be made
20  public which is expressly forbidden by the [War] Department of
21  Defense because of military security.
22     Section 10.  Section 1404(a) of the act, amended October 8,
