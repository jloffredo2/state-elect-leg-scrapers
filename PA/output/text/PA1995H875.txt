19  Fair Campaign Fund.

21  candidate who accepts public funding pursuant to the formula

15     (1) exercises any control or any direction over the making of
16  the contribution; or
17     (2) solicits the contribution or arranges for the
18  contribution to be made and directly or indirectly makes the
19  candidate aware of such intermediary or conduit's role in
