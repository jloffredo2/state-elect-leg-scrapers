15     Section 1.  The act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known
16  as the Pennsylvania Election Code, is amended by adding a
17  section to read:
18     Section 1302.4.  Standard for Invalidation of Certain
19  Ballots.--(a)  A ballot submitted in an election by an absent
20  uniformed services voter shall not be void on the grounds that
21  the ballot was improperly or fraudulently cast unless, upon
22  clear and convincing evidence, there is a finding of fraud in
1  the preparation or casting of the ballot by the voter. For
2  purposes of this subsection, the lack of a witness signature,
3  address, postmark or other identifying information may not be
4  considered clear and convincing evidence of fraud, absent any
5  other information or evidence.
6     (b)  Nothing in this section may be construed to affect the
7  application of any ballot submission deadline applicable to
8  ballots submitted by absent uniformed services voters under this
9  act.
10     (c)  The words "absent uniformed services voter" shall have
11  the meaning given such term in section 107(1) of the Uniformed
12  and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (Public Law 99-410,
13  100 Stat. 924).
14     Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
