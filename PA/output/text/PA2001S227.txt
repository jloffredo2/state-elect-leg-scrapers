5  lots as provided by this act. Under the title of such offices
6  where more than one candidate is to be voted for, shall be
7  printed "Vote for not more than ........" (the blank space to
8  indicate the number of candidates to be voted for the particular

10  be a square of sufficient size for the convenient insertion of a
11  cross (x) or check ( ) mark. There shall be left at the end of
12  the list of candidates for each office (or under the title of
13  the office itself in case there be no candidates who have filed
14  nomination petitions therefor) as many blank spaces as there are
15  persons to be voted for, for such office, in which space the
16  elector may insert the name of any person whose name is not
17  printed on the ballot as a candidate for such office. Opposite
18  or under the name of each candidate, except candidates for the
19  office of President of the United States, candidates for State-
20  wide judicial office and candidates for delegate or alternate
21  delegate to a National Party Convention, who is to be voted for
22  by the electors of more than one county, shall be printed the
23  name of the county in which such candidate resides; and opposite
24  or under the name of each candidate except candidates for
25  delegate or alternate delegate to a National Party Convention
26  who is to be voted for by the electors of an entire county or
27  any congressional, senatorial or representative district within
28  the county, shall be printed the name of the city, borough,
29  township or ward, as the case may be, in which such candidate
30  resides.
