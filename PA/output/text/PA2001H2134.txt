9  only for legitimate and verifiable campaign expenses and not for

29  expenditures made by a candidate for which the candidate is
30  reimbursed by his or her political committee within the
1  reporting period the expenditure was made. Such expenditure made
2  by the candidate is subject, however, to the requirements of
3  section 1626(c).
4     (e)  [The words "independent expenditure" shall mean an
5  expenditure by a person made for the purpose of influencing an
6  election without cooperation or consultation with any candidate

16  a candidate or any agent or authorized committee of the

2  communication that advocates the election or defeat of a
3  candidate by:
4     (i)  containing the name of the candidate, a picture of the
5  candidate or expressions such as "vote for", "elect", "support",
6  "vote against", "defeat" or "reject" or a campaign slogan or
7  words that in context can have no reasonable meaning other than
8  to advocate the election or defeat of one or more clearly
9  identified candidates;
10     (ii)  referring to one or more clearly identified candidates
11  in a paid advertisement that is transmitted through radio or

28  "support," "vote against," "defeat," or "reject" or other slogan
29  or words along with the name or picture of the candidate that in
30  context can have no reasonable meaning other than to urge the
1  election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidates.
2     (4)  The words "made with the cooperation or prior consent
3  of, in consultation or concert with or at the request or

5  of the candidate" shall mean any arrangement, coordination or
6  direction by the candidate or his agent prior to the
7  publication, distribution, display or broadcast of the
8  communication. An expenditure shall be presumed to be so made
9  when it is:
10     (i)  Based on information about the candidate's plans,
11  projects or needs provided to the expending person by the
12  candidate or by the candidate's agents, with a view toward
13  having an expenditure made.
14     (ii)  Made by or through any person who is or has been
15  authorized to raise or expend funds, who is or has been an
16  officer of an authorized committee, including a political party
17  committee, or who is or has been receiving any form of
18  compensation from the candidate, the candidate's committee or
19  agent.

1  need be filed under this section unless contributions were
2  received or expenditures made subsequent to the time period for
3  filing of such termination report. However, no candidate or

17  of elections for filing a report required by section 1626(e)
18  shall contain a block which may be marked by the candidate or
19  political committee designating it a termination report or
20  statement. No candidate or political committee may terminate
21  unless such candidate or committee has a zero balance. No
22  candidate or committee may terminate by way of a statement. In
