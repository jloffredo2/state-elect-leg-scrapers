19  said nomination petition or paper, a petition is presented to
20  the court specifically setting forth the objections thereto, and

11  face of the nomination petition or paper, the court, after
12  hearing, may, in its discretion, permit amendments within such
13  time and upon such terms as to payment of costs, as the said
14  court may specify. In case any such petition is dismissed, the
15  court shall make such order as to the payment of the costs of
16  the proceedings, including witness fees, as it shall deem just.

20  transmit the record to the appellate court as soon as
21  practicable. If a person shall sign any nomination petitions or
22  papers for a greater number of candidates than he is permitted
23  under the provisions of this act, if said signatures bear the
24  same date, they shall, upon objections filed thereto, not be
25  counted on any petition or paper and if they bear different

16  subsection (g) of this section. The list of names and addresses
17  thus obtained shall then be submitted by said representatives to
18  the board which shall furnish applications individually to those
19  appearing in the written request. If the chairman or head of a
20  political party or body fails to appoint a representative within

7  ballot, which number shall likewise appear on the official
8  absentee ballot for the qualified elector. The numbers shall
9  appear legibly and in a conspicuous place but before the ballots
10  are distributed the number on the ballot shall be torn off by
11  the county board of election. This number information shall be
12  appropriately inserted and become a part of the Registered
13  Absentee Voters File and the Military, Veterans and Emergency

21  absentee ballot and vote in the normal manner at the appropriate
22  voting place. Such forms shall be made freely available to the
23  public at county board of elections, municipal buildings and at

10  applicant is qualified to receive an official absentee ballot,
11  the application shall be marked approved such approval decision
12  shall be final and binding except that challenges may be made
13  only on the ground that the applicant did not possess

15  Challenges to applications received from qualified electors not
16  required to be registered under section 1301(i) must be made to
17  the county board of elections prior to 5:00 o'clock P. M. on the

25  Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters File as provided in section
26  1302.3, subsection (b): Providing, however, That no application
27  of any qualified elector in military service shall be rejected

30  the county board of elections.
1     (b) The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
2  application filed by a qualified elector who is entitled, under

5  registration prior to or concurrently with the time of voting as
6  provided under preceding section 1301, shall ascertain from the
7  information on such application or from any other source that
8  such applicant possesses all the qualifications of a qualified
9  elector. If the board is satisfied that the applicant is
10  entitled[, under the provisions of the Permanent Registration
11  Law as now or hereinafter enacted by the General Assembly,] to
12  absentee registration prior to or concurrently with the time of
13  voting and that the applicant is qualified to receive an
14  official absentee ballot, the application shall be marked
15  "approved." Such approval decision shall be final and binding
16  except that challenges may be made only on the ground that the
17  applicant did not possess the qualifications of an absentee
18  elector prior to or concurrently with the time of voting. Such
19  challenges must be made to the county board of elections prior
20  to [5:00 o'clock P. M. on the first Friday prior to] 8:00
21  o'clock P. M. on the day of the election. When so approved, the

23  residence (and at a primary, the party enrollment) to be
24  inserted in the Military, Veterans and Emergency Civilian
25  Absentee Voters File as provided in section 1302.3 subsection
26  (b).
27     (c)  The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
28  application of a qualified elector required to be registered
29  under the provisions of preceding section 1301, shall determine
30  the qualifications of such applicant by comparing the
1  information set forth on such application with the information
2  contained on the applicant's permanent registration card. If the
3  board is satisfied that the applicant is qualified to receive an
4  official absentee ballot, the application shall be marked
5  "approved." Such approval decision shall be final and binding,
6  except that challenges may be made only on the ground that the
7  applicant did not possess the qualifications of an absentee
8  elector. Such challenges must be made to the county board of
9  elections prior to 5:00 o'clock P. M. on the first Friday prior
10  to the election. When so approved, the registration commission
11  shall cause an absentee voter's temporary registration card to
12  be inserted in the district register on top of and along with
13  the permanent registration card. The absentee voter's temporary
14  registration card shall be in the color and form prescribed in
15  subsection (e) of this section:
16     Provided, however, That the duties of the county boards of

19  any elector from the district register as set forth in section
20  1302.2 shall include only such applications and emergency
21  applications as are received on or before the first Tuesday
22  prior to the primary or election. In all cases where
23  applications are received after the first Tuesday prior to the
24  primary or election and before five o'clock P. M. on the first
25  Friday prior to the primary or election, the county board of
26  elections shall determine the qualifications of such applicant
27  by comparing the information set forth on such application with

29  registration card on file in the General Register (also referred
30  to as the Master File) in the office of the Registration
1  Commission and shall cause the name and residence (and at
2  primaries, the party enrollment) to be inserted in the Military,

7  list of the election district of said elector's residence and
8  satisfy itself that such elector did not cast any ballot other
9  than the one properly issued to him under his absentee ballot
10  application. In all cases where the examination of the local
11  district board of elections discloses that an elector did vote a
12  ballot other than the one properly issued to him under the
13  absentee ballot application, the local district board of
14  elections shall thereupon cancel said absentee ballot and said
15  elector shall be subject to the penalties as hereinafter set
16  forth.
17     (d)  In the event that any application for an official
18  absentee ballot is not approved by the county board of
19  elections, the elector shall be notified immediately to that
20  effect with a statement by the county board of the reasons for
21  the disapproval.

23  be in duplicate and the same size as the permanent registration
24  card, in a different and contrasting color to the permanent
25  registration card and shall contain the absentee voter's name
26  and address and shall conspicuously contain the words "Absentee
27  Voter." Such card shall also contain the affidavit required by
28  subsection (b) of section 1306.

1  containing the duplicate absentee voter's temporary registration
2  cards of every registered elector to whom an absentee ballot has
3  been sent. Such duplicate absentee voter's temporary
4  registration cards shall be filed by election districts and

10  For those envelopes received from electors qualified in
11  accordance with section 1301(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g)

18  between third parties in the ordinary course of its business
19  throughout the year documents and packages deliverable to a
20  specific street address to the county board of elections.
21     (a.1)  Any elector qualified in accordance with section
22  1301(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) may vote in any
23  election for any office by submitting a Federal Write-In
24  Absentee Ballot prescribed by the Uniformed and Overseas
25  Citizens Absentee Voting Act (Public Law 99-410, 100 Stat. 924).
26  The submission and processing of a Federal Write-In Absentee
27  Ballot shall be governed by section 103 of the Uniformed and
28  Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act or its successor and this
29  act.
30     (b)  In the event that any such elector, excepting an elector
1  in military service or any elector unable to go to his polling
2  place because of illness or physical disability, entitled to
3  vote an official absentee ballot shall be in the municipality of
4  his residence on the day for holding the primary or election for
5  which the ballot was issued, or in the event any such elector
6  shall have recovered from his illness or physical disability
7  sufficiently to permit him to present himself at the proper
8  polling place for the purpose of casting his ballot, such
9  absentee ballot cast by such elector shall, be declared void.
10     Any such elector referred to in this subsection, who is
11  within the municipality of his residence, must present himself
12  at his polling place and shall be permitted to vote upon
13  presenting himself at his regular polling place in the same

18  temporary registration card, which affidavit shall be in
19  substantially the following form:
20     I hereby swear that I am a qualified registered elector who
21  has obtained an absentee ballot, however, I am present in the
22  municipality of my residence and physically able to present
23  myself at my polling place and therefore request that my
24  absentee ballot be voided.

28       (Local Judge of Elections)
29     An elector who has received an absentee ballot under the
30  emergency application provisions of section 1302.1, and for
1  whom, therefore, no temporary absentee voter's registration card
2  is in the district register, shall sign the aforementioned
3  affidavit in any case, which the local judge of elections shall
4  then cause to be inserted in the district register with the
5  elector's permanent registration card.
6     Section 11.  Section 1308 of the act, amended December 11,
7  1968 (P.L.1183, No.375), February 13, 1998 (P.L.72, No.18) and
8  December 9, 2002 (P.L.1246, No.150), is amended to read:
9     Section 1308.  Canvassing of Official Absentee Ballots.--
10     (a)  The county boards of election, upon receipt of official
11  absentee ballots in [such] official envelopes, shall safely keep
12  the same in sealed or locked containers until they distribute
13  same to the appropriate local election districts in a manner
14  prescribed by the Secretary of the Commonwealth.
15     The county board of elections shall then distribute the
16  absentee ballots, unopened, to the absentee voter's respective
17  election district concurrently with the distribution of the
18  other election supplies. Absentee ballots shall be canvassed
19  immediately and continuously without interruption until
20  completed after the close of the polls on the day of the
21  election in each election district. The results of the canvass
22  of the absentee ballots shall then be included in and returned
23  to the county board with the returns of that district. No
24  absentee ballot shall be counted which is received in the office
25  of the county board of election later than five o'clock P. M. on
26  the Friday immediately preceding the primary or November
27  election[.], except that the ballots received from electors
28  qualified in accordance with section 1301(a), (b), (c), (d),
29  (e), (f), (g) and (h) shall be canvassed if received by eight
30  o'clock P. M. on the day of the election or by the seventh day
1  following the election if such absentee ballot carries a
2  postmark dated no later than the day before the election.
3     (a.1)  Absentee ballots received from electors qualified in
4  accordance with section 1301(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g)
5  and (h) after the duplicate list was prepared and distributed to
6  the local election boards in accordance with section 1302.3(b.1)
7  and (c) but up until eight o'clock P. M. the day of the primary
8  or election ballots shall be canvassed at the official canvass
9  required for each election as required by section 1403. In all
10  cases where absentee ballots are received after the duplicate
11  list was prepared and distributed to the local election boards
12  in accordance with section 1302.3(b.1) but up until eight
13  o'clock P.M. the day of the primary or election, the county
14  board of elections shall examine the voting check list of the
15  election district of said elector's residence and satisfy itself
16  that such elector did not cast any ballot other than the one
17  properly issued to him under his absentee ballot application. In
18  all cases where such examination discloses that an elector did
19  vote a ballot other than the one properly issued to him under
20  the absentee ballot application, the board of elections shall
21  thereupon cancel said absentee ballot and said elector shall be
22  subject to the penalties as set forth in this act.
23     (b)  Each candidate for nomination or election shall be
24  entitled to appoint one watcher and each political party or body
25  which has nominated candidates shall be entitled to appoint two
26  watchers to be present at each canvass of absentee ballots.
27  Watchers shall be permitted to be present when the envelopes
28  containing official absentee ballots are opened and when such
29  ballots are counted and recorded.
30     (b.1)  In all election districts in which electronic voting
1  systems are used, absentee ballots shall be opened at the
2  election district, checked for write-in votes in accordance with
3  section 1113-A and then either hand-counted or counted by means
4  of the automatic tabulation equipment, whatever the case may be.
5     (d)  Whenever it shall appear by due proof that any absentee
6  elector who has returned his ballot in accordance with the
7  provisions of this act has died prior to the opening of the
8  polls on the day of the primary or election, the ballot of such
9  deceased elector shall be rejected by the canvassers but the
10  counting of the ballot of an elector thus deceased shall not of
11  itself invalidate any nomination or election.
12     (e)  At such time the local election board shall then further
13  examine the declaration on each envelope not so set aside and
14  shall compare the information thereon with that contained in the
15  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and
16  the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters
17  File." If the local election board is satisfied that the
18  declaration is sufficient and the information contained in the
19  "Registered Absentee Voters File," the absentee voters' list and
20  the "Military Veterans and Emergency Civilians Absentee Voters
21  File" verifies his right to vote, the local election board shall
22  announce the name of the elector and shall give any watcher
23  present an opportunity to challenge any absentee elector upon
24  the ground or grounds (1) that the absentee elector is not a
25  qualified elector; or (2) that the absentee elector was within
26  the municipality of his residence on the day of the primary or
27  election during the period the polls were open, except where he
28  was in military service or except in the case where his ballot
29  was obtained for the reason that he was unable to appear
30  personally at the polling place because of illness or physical
1  disability; or (3) that the absentee elector was able to appear
2  personally at the polling place on the day of the primary or
3  election during the period the polls were open in the case his
4  ballot was obtained for the reason that he was unable to appear
5  personally at the polling place because of illness or physical
6  disability. Upon challenge of any absentee elector, as set forth
7  herein the local election board shall mark "challenged" on the
8  envelope together with the reason or reasons therefor, and the
9  same shall be set aside for return to the county board unopened
10  pending decision by the county board and shall not be counted.
11  All absentee ballots not challenged for any of the reasons
12  provided herein shall be counted and included with the general
13  return of paper ballots or voting machines, as the case may be
14  as follows. Thereupon, the local election board shall open the
15  envelope of every unchallenged absentee elector in such manner
16  as not to destroy the declaration executed thereon. All of such
17  envelopes on which are printed, stamped or endorsed the words
18  "Official Absentee Ballot" shall be placed in one or more
19  depositories at one time and said depository or depositories
20  well shaken and the envelopes mixed before any envelope is taken
21  therefrom. If any of these envelopes shall contain any
22  extraneous marks or identifying symbols other than the words
23  "Official Absentee Ballot," the envelopes and the ballots
24  contained therein shall be set aside and declared void. The
25  local election board shall then break the seals of such
26  envelopes, remove the ballots and record the votes in the same
27  manner as district election officers are required to record
28  votes. With respect to the challenged ballots, they shall be
29  returned to the county board with the returns of the local
30  election district where they shall be placed unopened in a
1  secure, safe and sealed container in the custody of the county
2  board until it shall fix a time and place for a formal hearing
3  of all such challenges and notice shall be given where possible
4  to all absentee electors thus challenged and to every attorney,
5  watcher or candidate who made such challenge. The time for the
6  hearing shall not be later than seven (7) days after the date of
7  said challenge. On the day fixed for said hearing, the county
8  board shall proceed without delay to hear said challenges and,
9  in hearing the testimony, the county board shall not be bound by
10  technical rules of evidence. The testimony presented shall be
11  stenographically recorded and made part of the record of the
12  hearing. The decision of the county board in upholding or
13  dismissing any challenge may be reviewed by the court of common
14  pleas of the county upon a petition filed by any person
15  aggrieved by the decision of the county board. Such appeal shall
16  be taken, within two (2) days after such decision shall have
17  been made, whether reduced to writing or not, to the court of
18  common pleas setting forth the objections to the county board's
19  decision and praying for an order reversing same. Pending the
20  final determination of all appeals, the county board shall
21  suspend any action in canvassing and computing all challenged
22  ballots irrespective of whether or not appeal was taken from the
23  county board's decision. Upon completion of the computation of
24  the returns of the county, the votes cast upon the challenged
25  official absentee ballots shall be added to the other votes cast
26  within the county.
27     (e.1)  Absentee ballots cast by electors qualified in
28  accordance with section 1301(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g)
29  and (h) and received after the canvass required by subsection
30  (a) but by the seventh day following the election which are
1  postmarked no later than the day before the election shall be
2  canvassed in a separate canvass to occur no later than eight (8)
3  days after the election to be conducted in accordance with the
4  procedures required by this section for the first canvass of
5  absentee ballots. Such absentee ballots shall be subject to the
6  challenge procedures specified in subsection (e). The board
7  shall add the results for the second canvass to the totals of
8  the first canvass by election district.
9     (f)  Any person challenging an application for an absentee
10  ballot or an absentee ballot for any of the reasons provided in
11  this act shall deposit the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) in cash
12  with the local election board, in cases of challenges made to
13  the local election board and with the county board in cases of
14  challenges made to the county board for which he shall be issued
15  a receipt for each challenge made, which sum shall only be
16  refunded if the challenge is sustained or if the challenge is
17  withdrawn within [five (5) days] ten (10) days after the primary
18  or election. If the challenge is dismissed by any lawful order
19  then the deposit shall be forfeited. All deposit money received
20  by the local election board shall be turned over to the county
21  board simultaneously with the return of the challenged ballots.
22  The county board shall deposit all deposit money in the general
23  fund of the county.
24     Notice of the requirements of subsection (b) of section 1306
25  shall be printed on the envelope for the absentee ballot.

5  Defense because of military security.

14  publicly commence the computation and canvassing of the returns,
15  and continue the same from day to day until completed, in the
16  manner hereinafter provided. For this purpose any county board
17  may organize itself into sections, each of which may
18  simultaneously proceed with the computation and canvassing of
19  the returns from various districts of the county in the manner
20  provided by this section. The return board shall reconvene at
