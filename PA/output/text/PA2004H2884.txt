9     (e)  Provision for Recanvass of Vote.--[(1)]  Whenever it
10  shall appear that there is a discrepancy in the returns of any
11  election district, or, upon petition of three voters of any
12  district, verified by affidavit, that an error, although not
13  apparent on the face of the returns, has been committed therein,
14  or of its own motion or under subsection (g), the county board
15  shall at any time prior to the completion of the computation of
16  all of the returns for the county, summon the election officers
17  of the district, and said officers, in the presence of said
18  board, shall [make a record of the number of the seal upon the
19  voting machine, and the number on the protective counter or
20  other device; shall make visible the registering counters of
21  such machine, and, without unlocking the machine against voting,
22  shall] conduct a recount or recanvass [the vote] of all ballots
23  cast [thereon]. Before making such recount or recanvass, the
24  said board shall give notice in writing to the proper custodian
25  of voting machines, and to each candidate, and to the county
26  chairman of each party or political body, affected by the
27  [canvass,] recount or recanvass; and each such candidate may be
28  present in person, or by attorney, and each of such parties, or
29  bodies, may send two representatives to be present at such
30  recount or recanvass.
1     (1)  In a county in which an election district uses voting
2  machines, all of the following apply:
3     (i)  The county board shall:
4     (A)  make a record of the number of the seal upon the voting
5  machine and the number on the protective counter or other
6  device;
7     (B)  make visible the registering counters of such machine;
8  and
9     (C)  without unlocking the machine against voting, recanvass
10  the vote cast on the machine.
11     (ii)  If, upon such recanvass, it shall be found that the
12  original canvass of the returns has been correctly made from the
13  machine, and that the discrepancy still remains unaccounted for,
14  the said board, with the assistance of the custodian, in the
15  presence of the election officers and the authorized candidates
16  and representatives, shall unlock the voting and counting
17  mechanism of the machine, and shall proceed thoroughly to
18  examine and test the machine to determine and reveal the true
19  cause or causes, if any, of the discrepancy in returns from such
20  machine. Each counter shall be reset at zero (000) before it is
21  tested, after which it shall be operated at least one hundred
22  times. After the completion of such examination and test, the
23  custodian shall then and there prepare a statement, in writing,
24  giving in detail the result of the examination and test, and
25  such statement shall be witnessed by the persons present, and
26  shall be filed with the said board.
27     (iii)  If, upon such recanvass, it shall appear that the
28  original canvass of the returns by the election officers was
29  incorrect, the said returns and all papers being prepared by the
30  said board shall be corrected accordingly: [(2)]  Provided,
1  however, That in the case of returns from any election district
2  wherein the election was held by the use of a voting machine
3  equipped with mechanism for printing paper proof sheets, said
4  proof sheets, if mutually consistent, shall be deemed to be the
5  primary evidence of the result of the election and to be prima
6  facie accurate, and there shall not be considered to be any
7  discrepancy or error in the returns from any such district, such
8  as to require a recanvass of the vote, if all available proof
9  sheets, from the voting machine used therein, identified to the
10  satisfaction of the return board and shown to its satisfaction
11  to have been produced from proper custody, shall be mutually
12  consistent, and, if the general and duplicate returns, or either
13  of them, from said district shall not correspond with said proof
14  sheets, they, and all other papers being prepared by said return
15  board, shall be corrected so as to correspond with the same, in
16  the absence of allegation of specific fraud or error, proved to
17  the satisfaction of the return board by the weight of the
18  evidence, and only in such case shall the vote of said election
19  district be recanvassed under the provisions of this section.
20     (2)  In a county in which an election district uses paper
21  ballots other than those used in conjunction with an electronic
22  voting system, all of the following apply:
23     (i)  The county board shall, in the presence of the election
24  officers and the authorized candidates and representatives,
25  cause:
26     (A)  the ballot box of each district to be opened and the
27  vote in the ballot box to be recounted; and
28     (B)  the entire vote of the election district to be counted
29  correctly.

1  overseers to appear with all election papers in their possession
2  to assist in determining an accurate count or addressing errors
3  and omissions.
4     (3)  In a county in which an election district uses an
5  electronic voting system utilizing paper ballots, all of the
6  following apply:
7     (i)  The county board shall recount all ballots using manual,
8  mechanical or electronic devices of a different type used for
9  the specific election.
10     (ii)  All ballots containing overvotes shall be counted
11  manually.
12     (4)  In a county in which an election district uses any other
13  type of electronic voting systems, the county board shall
14  conduct the recanvass similar to the procedure specified in
15  clause (1) for voting machines.
16     (f)  As the returns from each election district are read,
17  computed and found to be correct or corrected as aforesaid, they
18  shall be recorded on the blanks prepared for the purpose until
19  all the returns from the various election districts which are
20  entitled to be counted shall have been duly recorded, when they
21  shall be added together, announced and attested by the clerks
22  who made and computed the entries respectively and signed by the
23  members of the county board. Returns under this subsection shall
24  be considered unofficial for five (5) days. The county board
25  shall submit the unofficial returns to the Secretary of the
26  Commonwealth by five o'clock P.M. on the Monday following the
27  election. The submission shall be as directed by the secretary
28  for an office for which a candidate must file a nomination
29  petition with the secretary. At the expiration of five (5) days
30  after the completion of the computation of votes, in case no
1  petition for a recount or recanvass has been filed in accordance
2  with the provisions of this act, or upon the completion of the
3  recount or recanvass if a petition therefor has been filed
4  within five (5) days after the completion of the computation of
5  votes, the county board shall certify the returns so computed in
6  said county in the manner required by this act, unless upon
7  appeals taken from any decision, the court of common pleas shall
8  have directed any returns to be revised, or unless in case of a
9  recount, errors in the said returns shall have been found, in
10  which case said returns shall be revised, corrected and
11  certified accordingly. The county board shall thereupon, in the
12  case of elections, issue certificates of election to the
13  successful candidates for all county, city, borough, township,
14  ward, school district, poor district and election offices, and
15  local party offices to be filled by the votes of the electors of
16  said county, or of any part thereof.
17     (g)  This subsection relates to recounts and recanvasses
18  ordered by the secretary.
19     (1)  Except as set forth in subsection (h), the secretary
20  shall order a recount and recanvass to all county boards if the

29  writing that a recount and recanvass not be made. A request
30  under this subsection must be made by 12 o'clock noon on the
1  second Wednesday following the election.
2     Section 9.  Section 1407 of the act, repealed in part April
3  28, 1978 (P.L.202, No.53), is amended to read:
4     Section 1407.  Appeals to Court from Decisions of the County
5  Board.--
6     (a)  Any person aggrieved by any order or decision of any
7  county board regarding the computation or canvassing of the
8  returns of any primary or election, or regarding any recount or
9  recanvass thereof under sections 1701, 1702 and 1703 of this
10  act, may appeal therefrom within two days after such order or
11  decision shall have been made, whether then reduced to writing
12  or not, to the court [of common pleas of the proper county]
13  specified in this subsection, setting forth why he feels that an
14  injustice has been done, and praying for such order as will give
15  him relief. If a recount or recanvass is made under section
16  1404(g), the appeal must be made to Commonwealth Court. Unless a
17  recount or recanvass is made under section 1404(g), the appeal
18  must be made to the court of common pleas of the proper county.
19  Upon the payment to the prothonotary of a fee for filing such
20  appeal, a judge of the court shall fix a time and place for
21  hearing the matter in dispute within three days thereafter, of
22  which due notice shall be served, with a copy of such appeal, by
23  the appellant upon a member of the county board whose action is
24  complained of and upon every attorney, watcher or candidate who
25  opposed the contention of the appellant before the county board,
26  and upon any other person that the judge shall direct, at least
27  two days before the matter shall be reviewed by the court. Proof
28  of such notice or the waiver thereof must be filed therein
29  before any appeal is sustained.
30     (b)  The court on an appeal shall have full power and
1  authority to hear and determine all matters pertaining to any
2  fraud or error committed in any election district to which such
3  appeal relates, and to make such decree as right and justice may
4  require. Pending such appeal, the county board shall suspend any
5  official certification of the votes cast in such election
6  district. None of the orders or decisions of either the county
7  board or the court of common pleas on appeal shall be deemed a
8  final adjudication regarding the results of any primary or
9  election, so as to preclude any contest thereof. No appeal shall
10  be allowed or granted from any order or decree of the court of
11  common pleas made in pursuance of this section. The court of
12  common pleas, upon any appeal under this section, may compel the
13  appellant or any opposing party, other than the county board, to
14  pay all the witness fees, if any, or other legal costs of the
15  hearing, which costs may be taxed by the prothonotary in the
16  usual manner.
17     Section 10.  Section 1701 of the act is amended to read:
18     Section 1701.  Opening Ballot Boxes upon Petition of Electors
19  Alleging Fraud or Error; Deposit or Bond.--(a)  [The] Except as

23  such election district used at any general, municipal, special
24  or primary election held therein, and cause the entire vote
25  thereof to be correctly counted by persons designated by such
26  court or judge, if three qualified electors of the election
27  district shall file, as hereinafter provided, a petition duly
28  verified by them, alleging that upon information which they
29  consider reliable they believe that fraud or error, although not
30  manifest on the general return of votes made therefrom, was
1  committed in the computation of the votes cast for all offices
2  or for any particular office or offices in such election
3  district, or in the marking of the ballots, or otherwise in
4  connection with such ballots. It shall not be necessary for the
5  petitioners to specify in their petition the particular act of
6  fraud or error which they believe to have been committed, nor to

25     (B)  in the marking of the ballots; or
26     (C)   otherwise in connection with the ballots.
27     (ii)  It is not be necessary for the petitioners to specify

12  contained therein, or fraud in the marking of the ballots
13  contained therein, or otherwise in connection with such ballots.
14     (c)  Before any ballot box is opened under the provisions of
15  this section, the court shall direct that notice of time and

18  which are to be recounted by the order of the court, and each
19  such candidate may be present at such recount, either in person
20  or by his attorney or by his duly authorized representative,
21  under such regulations as the court may prescribe.
22     (d)  If, upon opening any such ballot box, it shall appear
23  that fraud or substantial error was committed in the computation
24  of the votes cast on the ballots contained therein, or fraud in
25  the marking of the ballots contained therein, or otherwise in
26  connection with such ballots, it shall be the duty of the court
27  to certify such fact to the prothonotary and thereupon the
28  prothonotary shall return to the petitioners the said sum of
29  fifty ($50.00) dollars, or if the petitioners shall have filed a

3  this section, it shall not appear that fraud or substantial
4  error was committed in the computation of the votes cast on the
5  ballots contained therein, or fraud in the marking of the
6  ballots contained therein, or otherwise in connection with such
7  ballots, the persons upon whose petition such ballot box shall
8  have been opened shall forfeit to the county the sum of fifty
9  ($50.00) dollars. If said petitioners shall have deposited the
10  said sum in cash with the prothonotary at the time of filing the

23  section at any time within four months after the date of the
24  general, municipal, special or primary election at which the
25  ballots therein shall have been cast.

4  of the voting machine or machines used in such election district
5  at any primary or election, and without unlocking the machine
6  against voting, shall recanvass the vote cast therein, if three

11  therefrom, was committed in the canvassing of the votes cast on
12  such machine or machines. It shall not be necessary for the
13  petitioners to specify in their petition the particular act of
14  fraud or error they believe to have been committed, nor to offer

2  shall be the duty of the court to certify such fact to the
3  prothonotary, and thereupon the prothonotary shall return to the

7  adjudication regarding the results of any primary or election,
8  so as to preclude any contest thereof under the provisions of
9  this article, and no such order or decision shall affect the
10  official returns of any election district, unless a petition to
11  open the ballot boxes or to recanvass the votes on a voting
