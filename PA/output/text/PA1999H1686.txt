24         evidence or proof of the qualifications of the elector to
25         vote at an election or proof of identification for
26         purposes of applying for or receiving general assistance
27         and that it is not necessary to present the card when
28         voting. The statements required by this subparagraph
29         shall be placed on the reverse side of the card from
30         where all of the other information required by this
1         paragraph is placed.

15         address, the commission shall investigate. If the
16         commission finds that the applicant is not qualified to
17         register from such address, the commission shall reject
18         the application of the applicant and shall notify the
19         applicant by first class forwardable mail of this action.

21         restrict a qualified elector from circulating or signing
22         nomination petitions or nomination papers if that person
23         does not currently possess all the necessary
24         qualifications in subparagraph (i), provided that a
25         qualified elector must be an applicant for registration

3     (b)  Voter removal program.--
4         (1)  The commission shall establish a program to identify
5     electors whose address may have changed by establishing one
6     of the following programs:
7             (i)  National change of address. The [secretary shall
8         establish by regulation a program whereby] commission may
9         use information supplied by the United States Postal
10         Service through its licensees [is used] on a periodic
11         basis, but not less than once every calendar year, to
12         identify electors who may have changed [addresses] their
13         addresses. [The information shall be incorporated in the
14         administration of the Statewide central registry and
15         shall be forwarded to the commissions in a manner
16         determined by the secretary by regulation.]
17                 (A)  If it appears from the information provided
18             through the United States Postal Service that an
19             elector has moved to a different residence address
20             within the same county as the elector is currently
21             registered, the commission shall change the
22             registration records to show the new address and
23             shall send the elector, to the address [recorded on
24             the elector's registration] of prior residence, a
25             notice of the change of address by forwardable mail
26             and a postage prepaid, preaddressed return form by
27             which the elector may verify or correct the address
28             information. If a notice under this clause is
29             returned with a corrected address, the commission
30             shall change the address. If a notice under this
1             clause is not returned by the elector confirming the
2             change of address or the notice is returned by the
3             United States Postal Service as undeliverable, the
4             commission shall direct a confirmation notice to the
5             registrant's new address or best available address in
6             accordance with subsection (d)(2).
7                 (B)  If it appears from the information provided
8             through the United States Postal Service that an
9             elector has moved to a different residence address
10             outside the county, the commission shall use the
11             notice procedure described in [clause (A)] subsection
12             (d)(2).
13             (ii)  Confirmation mailing:
14                 (A)  A commission may establish a program by
15             sending a direct, nonforwardable first class "return
16             [if undeliverable - address correction] service
17             requested" mailing to all registered electors in the
18             county.
19                 (B)  If this program is established, the
20             commission shall use the notice procedure described
21             in subparagraph (i)(A) for any elector whose mailing
22             is returned undeliverable[.] and it appears that such
23             elector has moved to an address within the same
24             county. If a mailing is returned as undeliverable and
25             it appears that an elector has moved to a different
26             residence address outside the county or if no further
27             address information is available, the commission
28             shall use the notice procedures described in
29             subsection (d)(2).
30         (2)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
1     program established under paragraph (1), a canvass may be
2     used as follows:
3             (i)  The registration commission may, by
4         commissioners or by inspectors of registration, verify
5         the registration in an election district by visiting the
6         building from which an elector is registered and other
7         buildings as the commission deems necessary.
8             (ii)  The commission shall make a record of the name
9         and address of each registered elector who is found not
10         to reside at the registered address or who for any other
11         reason appears to be not qualified to vote in the
12         registered election district.
13             (iii)  The commission shall leave at the address of
14         each person referred to in subparagraph (ii) a notice
15         requiring him to communicate with the commission on or
16         before a date which the commission shall designate, and
17         which shall be not less than seven days and not more than
18         15 days from the date of the notice and in any case not
19         later than the 15th day preceding the election next
20         ensuing, and satisfy the commission of his qualifications
21         as an elector. The commission shall cause a confirmation
22         of each such notice to be sent by mail promptly to such
23         person at the address from which he is registered. The
24         envelope containing such information is to be plainly
25         marked that it is not to be forwarded. At the expiration
26         of the time specified in the notice, the commission shall
27         cancel the registration of such person who has not
28         communicated with the commission and proved his
29         qualifications as an elector.
30             (iv)  To facilitate the canvass under this section,
1         the commission may, when necessary, appoint special
2         inspectors of registration, in number not exceeding
3         double the number of election districts being canvassed.
4             (v)  Special inspectors must be qualified electors of
5         the county. They shall be appointed without reference to
6         residence in election districts or to political
7         affiliations or beliefs. The commission shall instruct
8         special inspectors in their duties. Special inspectors
9         have the powers conferred by this act upon inspectors of
10         registration.
11         (3)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
12     program established under paragraph (1), the commission
13     [shall] may send a notice pursuant to subsection (d) to any
14     elector who has not voted nor appeared to vote during the
15     period beginning five years before the date of the notice and
16     ending on the date of the notice and for whom the board of
17     elections did not during that period in any other way receive
18     any information that the voter still resides in the
19     registered election district.
20         (4)  Commissions shall complete, not later than 90 days
21     before each primary or general election, at least once per
22     year one of the voter removal programs under this section.
23     This paragraph shall not be construed to preclude any of the
24     following:
25             (i)  Cancellation of an elector's registration as
26         provided for under subsection (a)(1) or (2).
27             (ii)  Correction of registration records in
28         accordance with this act.
29     (c)  Identification of inactive voters.--A commission shall
30  mark an "I" on the registration card of each elector who has
1  been mailed a form under subsection [(b)(1) or (3)] (d)(2) and
2  has failed to respond, which shall be included with all other
3  registration cards for that polling site and located at the
4  individual's polling site on the day of the election.
5     * * *
6     Section 2.  Section 1902 of the act is amended by adding a
7  subsection to read:
8  Section 1902.  Procedure for voting following failure to return
9                 notification card.
10     * * *
11     (c)  Examination of affirmations.--Following the election,
12  the commission shall examine affirmations completed under this
13  section. If the elector has affirmed a change of address within
14  the county, the commission shall update the elector's voter
15  registration records. If the elector has affirmed a change of
16  address outside of the county, the commission shall cancel the
17  elector's registration and notify the elector in accordance with
18  this act.
19     Section 3.  Section 1903 of the act is amended to read:
20  Section 1903.  Incorrect records.
21     [If] At any election, if an elector claims that registration
22  records incorrectly indicate that [an] the elector has moved
23  from an address in the area covered by a polling place, the
24  elector shall, upon written affirmation before an election
25  official at that polling place, be permitted to vote at that
26  polling place. Following the election, the commission shall
27  examine affirmations completed under this section and correct
28  the electors' voter registration records accordingly.
29     Section 4.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.
