20     (a)  Development and implementation.--
21         (1)  The department shall develop and implement uniform
22     voting procedures that shall be used at all elections held in
23     this Commonwealth. In developing and implementing uniform
24     voting procedures, the department may use any available
25     research and reports issued by Federal or State agencies
26     relevant to developing and implementing uniform voting
27     procedures.
28         (2)  Prior to implementing uniform voting procedures, the
29     department shall receive input from counties, including
30     comments and recommendations from members of county boards
1     and district election boards.
2     (b)  Criteria for uniform voting procedures.--In developing
3  and implementing uniform voting procedures, the department shall
4  use, but is not limited to, the following criteria:
5         (1)  The procedures shall be easy for qualified electors
6     to understand and use. In order to assist the district
7     election board in confirming a qualified elector's
8     registration and in resolving registration problems, the
9     procedures may include the use by qualified electors of an
10     identification card that may be read at the polling place by
11     a computer linking the district election board directly to
12     the county board.
13         (2)  The procedures shall protect the privacy of
14     qualified electors and the security of their votes and shall
15     prevent voter fraud.
16         (3)  The procedures shall provide prompt and accurate
17     election results from the district election board to the
18     county board, media and public. The procedures may include a
19     computer network that directly links the district election
20     board at the polling place to the county board for prompt and
21     secure transmission of election results.
22         (4)  The procedures shall be standardized for use at all
23     elections held in this Commonwealth. The procedures may not
24     include punch cards and other voting methods that could
25     potentially result in incorrect voting such as double voting.
26         (5)  The procedures shall use technological advances
27     including systems that utilize touch-screen computers and the
28     Internet.
29  Section 4.  Repeals.
30     All acts and parts of acts are repealed insofar as they are
1  inconsistent with the provisions of this act.
2  Section 5.  Applicability.
3     The uniform voting procedures developed pursuant to this act
4  shall be implemented and applied to all elections held in this
5  Commonwealth on or after January 1, 2009.
