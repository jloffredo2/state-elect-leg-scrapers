19  his residence on the day for holding the primary or election for
20  which the ballot was issued, or in the event any such elector
21  shall have recovered from his illness or physical disability
22  sufficiently to permit him to present himself at the proper
23  polling place for the purpose of casting his ballot, such
24  absentee ballot cast by such elector shall, be declared void.
25     Any such elector referred to in this subsection, who is
26  within the municipality of his residence, must present himself
27  at his polling place and shall be permitted to vote upon
28  presenting himself at his regular polling place in the same
29  manner as he could have voted had he not received an absentee
30  ballot: Provided, That such elector has first presented himself
1  to the judge of elections in his local election district and
2  shall have signed the affidavit on the absentee voter's
3  temporary registration card, which affidavit shall be in
4  substantially the following form:
5     I hereby swear that I am a qualified registered elector who
6  has obtained an absentee ballot, however, I am present in the
7  municipality of my residence and physically able to present
8  myself at my polling place and therefore request that my
9  absentee ballot be voided.

17  is in the district register, shall sign the aforementioned
18  affidavit in any case, which the local judge of elections shall
19  then cause to be inserted in the district register with the
20  elector's permanent registration card.

22  after December 31, 2005.
