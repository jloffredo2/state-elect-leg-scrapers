26     Section 4.  Section 1004 of the act, amended February 19,

28     Section 1004.  Form of Ballots; Printing Ballots; Stubs;
29  Numbers.--From the lists furnished by the Secretary of the
30  Commonwealth under the provisions of sections [915] 916 and 984,
1  and from petitions and papers filed in their office and the
2  random rotational order established under the provisions of
3  section 916.1, the county election board shall print the
4  official primary and election ballots in accordance with the
5  provisions of this act: Provided, however, That in no event,
6  shall the name of any person consenting to be a candidate for
7  nomination for any one office, except the office of judge of a
8  court of common pleas, the Philadelphia Municipal Court or the
9  Traffic Court of Philadelphia, or the office of school director
10  in districts where that office is elective or the office of
11  justice of the peace be printed as a candidate for such office
12  upon the official primary ballot of more than one party. All
13  ballots for use in the same election district at any primary or
14  election shall be alike. They shall be at least six inches long
15  and four inches wide, and shall have a margin extending beyond
16  any printing thereon. They shall be printed with the same kind
17  of type (which shall not be smaller than the size known as
18  "brevier" or "eight point body") upon white paper of uniform
19  quality, without any impression or mark to distinguish one from
20  another, and with sufficient thickness to prevent the printed
21  matter from showing through. Each ballot shall be attached to a
22  stub, and all the ballots for the same election district shall
23  be bound together in books of fifty, in such manner that each
24  ballot may be detached from its stub and removed separately. The
25  ballots for each party to be used at a primary shall be bound
26  separately. The stubs of the ballots shall be consecutively
27  numbered, and in the case of primary ballots, the number shall
28  be preceded by an initial or abbreviation designating the party
29  name. The number and initial or abbreviation which appears upon
30  the stub shall also be printed in the upper right hand corner of
1  the back of the ballot, separated from the remainder of the
2  ballot by a diagonal perforated line so prepared that the upper
3  right hand corner of the back of the ballot containing the
4  number may be detached from the ballot before it is deposited in
5  the ballot box and beside that corner shall also be printed,
6  "Remove numbered stub immediately before depositing your ballot
7  in ballot box."
8     Section 5.  This act shall take effect January 1, 2005.
