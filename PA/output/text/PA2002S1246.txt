9         required by this act. Data uploaded to the SURE system
10         must be in the format required by the department and must
11         include all data elements from the registrant's voter
12         registration application and the digitized signature of
13         the registrant. Each county participating in the SURE
14         system in accordance with this subparagraph shall upload
15         voter registration records daily according to a schedule
16         established by the secretary. The county data base shall
17         constitute the general register for all counties that
18         connect to the SURE system pursuant to this section. A
19         county selecting this alternative must have its
20         electronic interface approved by the department prior to
21         connecting to the SURE system to insure that information
22         is being delivered to the department and received by the
23         county in the format required by the SURE system. The
24         electronic interface shall be bidirectional to be used
25         for the daily exchange of registration records and
26         digitized signature files between the SURE data base and
27         the commission's system in the format able to be read by
28         both the county and the SURE system. The development and
29         cost of this portion of the electronic interface shall be
30         shared equally by the department and the respective
1         county. Any county selecting this option which does not
2         at the time of notifying the department in accordance
3         with subsection (d) utilize signature digitization must
4         have contracted for digitized signature conversion and
5         begun such conversion within one year of filing the
6         notification required in subsection (d).
7             (ii)  If the SURE system is upgraded in such a way
8         that makes the county interface inoperable the State
9         shall pay for any costs to update the interface. If any
10         county subsequently decides to upgrade its hardware or
11         software in such a way that makes the interface
12         inoperable, the county shall pay for any costs to update
13         the interface.
14     (d)  Timetable.--The timetable for implementation of the SURE
15  system shall be established by the secretary but in no case
16  shall be later than three years after the effective date of this
17  act unless otherwise approved by the General Assembly. The
18  secretary may phase in the use of the system on a county-by-
19  county basis, provided, however, that no county shall use the
20  registry for any purpose authorized by this act until the
21  secretary shall certify that all proper tests have been
22  conducted insuring that the system as established in the county
23  is capable of performing according to all requirements of this
24  act and that the conversion interfaces accurately convert the
25  county registration record and digitized signature files to the
26  SURE format. The commission of each county shall select the
27  alternatives specified in subsection (c) for use in their county
28  and notify the secretary within 30 days of the effective date of
29  this act which option they have selected. Once a commission has
30  selected participation under subsection (c)(1), it may not
1  change the option it has selected. A commission that has
2  selected the option in subsection (c)(2) may at a later date
3  request a change to the option in subsection (c)(1).
4     (e)  Advisory board.--The secretary shall appoint an advisory
5  board to assist the department in developing and implementing
6  the SURE system composed of one representative of the County
7  Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania and one representative
8  of a commission of each class county of the Commonwealth. All
9  meetings of the board shall be recorded and shall be open to the
10  public.

11         Federal or State employee, the individual's registration
12         shall be canceled under Chapter 9.

17         commission shall forward the registrant's registration
18         [card] record from the general register and original
19         record to the commission of the registrant's new county

30         signature of the registrant, the commission receiving the
1         change of address notification shall mail a notice to the
2         registrant at the new residence address requesting
3         verification of the address change. If the change of
4         address is to a new residence outside the commission's
5         jurisdiction, the commission shall mail the following
6         notice:
7         Date................

12         that you recently changed your address from
13         ................. (old residence address) to
14         ............... (new residence address) and that this
15         change of address is to serve as a change of address for
16         voter registration purposes. Unless you notify this
17         office within ten days from the date of this notice that
18         this information is not correct, your voter registration
19         will be transferred to ........... County. You may notify
20         this office by writing your residence address, the date
21         and your signature on the bottom of this form and mailing
22         this notice to this office. You need not notify this

26         If the address change is within the commission's
27         jurisdiction, the county shall mail a voter's
28         identification card to the registrant at the new
29         residence address.
30             (iii)  If the registrant does not return the notice
1         under subparagraph (ii) within the ten-day period, the
2         commission shall process the change of address according
3         to subparagraph (i). If the registrant notifies the
4         commission that the information is incorrect and the
5         commission is satisfied with the registrant's explanation
6         of the discrepancy, the address of the registrant's
7         registration shall remain unchanged. If the verification
8         notification or voter identification card is returned by
9         the post office as undeliverable as addressed or with a
10         forwarding address, the commission shall send a
11         confirmation notice to the registrant's address of former
12         residence in accordance with section 1901(d)(2).

27  Section 528.  Approval of registration applications.
28     * * *
29     (b)  Decision.--
30         (1)  If the commission finds the official registration
1     application not properly completed, the application shall be
2     rejected. The commission should make reasonable efforts to
3     complete the registration before rejecting it for omissions
4     and inconsistencies. If the commission rejects an application
5     under this paragraph, it shall indicate "REJECTED" on the
6     application and state there the reason for rejection and
7     notify the applicant by first class nonforwardable mail,
8     return postage guaranteed. A record of a rejected
9     registration application filed electronically shall be
10     preserved on the registry. Registration applications
11     originating on paper shall be retained in accordance with the
12     provisions of this act.
13         (2)  If the official registration application contains
14     the required information indicating that the applicant is
15     legally qualified to register as stated in the application,
16     the commission shall mail to the applicant a voter's
17     identification card in accordance with subsection (d)(1).
18         (3)  For an application for a transfer of registration or

20     required information and the applicant is legally qualified
21     to transfer registration or change name or address as stated
22     in the application, the commission shall make the transfer or
23     change. If the commission suspects that the applicant is not
24     entitled to transfer registration or to change name or
25     address, the commission may investigate. If the commission
26     finds that the applicant is not entitled to the transfer or
27     change, the application shall be rejected. The applicant
28     shall be notified of the rejection and the reason for it.
29     Rejection shall be made no later than ten days before the
30     election succeeding the filing of the application.
1     (c)  Result.--[If an] Until such time as the commission is
2  able to use the SURE system for the administration of voter
3  registration pursuant to this act, if a voter registration
4  application is designed to serve as a registration card, the
5  accepted application of an elector may serve as the elector's
6  official registration card, if it was so designed, and shall be
7  filed in the office of the commission in accordance with Chapter
8  7. If the application is not designed to serve as a registration
9  card, the information contained on the application, including
10  the elector's signature, shall be transferred to the
11  registration card. If a commission utilizes a signature
12  digitization list, it shall transfer all information contained
13  on the application, including the signature, to the registry or,
14  until the registry is established, to a computer file. Once the
15  commission is connected to the registry, the information
16  contained on an approved voter registration application,
17  including the elector's signature, shall be transferred to the
18  registry. If the approved application has been submitted
19  electronically, the commission shall make it a permanent record
20  of the registry and print a paper copy and process it according
21  to section 702(b)(1). Applicants for registration shall be
22  challenged under section 529. For purposes of this subsection a
23  registration card shall be a card containing all information
24  required on the registration application, including the
25  elector's signature, and suitable space for the insertion by the
26  appropriate official of the following information:
27         (1)  The ward and election district of residence.
28         (2)  The registrant's street address.
29         (3)  Data required to be given upon removal from the
30     registrant's residence.
1         (4)  The date of each election at which the registrant
2     votes.
3         (5)  The number and letter of the stub of the ballot
4     issued to the registrant or the registrant's number in the
5     order of admission to the voting machines.
6         (6)  The initials of the election officer who enters the
7     record of voting in the district register.
8         (7)  Whether the registrant needs assistance to vote and,

12     (a)  [Original registration] Registration cards.--[If] Before
13  a commission is connected to the SURE system, if a commission
14  uses the original registration cards for registered electors in
15  the county as the district register, the duplicate registration
16  cards or photocopies of the original registration cards shall be
17  placed in exact alphabetical order by last name of the
18  registrant, shall be indexed and shall be kept at the office of
19  the registration commission in a manner as to be properly
20  safeguarded. These cards constitute the general register of the
21  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
22  commission except upon order of a court of record. Nothing in
23  this act shall preclude the use of duplicate registration cards
24  from applications provided under the act of March 30, 1937
25  (P.L.115, No.40), known as The First Class City Permanent
26  Registration Act, or the act of April 29, 1937 (P.L.487,
27  No.115), known as The Permanent Registration Act for Cities of
28  the Second Class, Cities of the Second Class A, Cities of the
29  Third Class, Boroughs, Towns, and Townships.
30     (b)  Digitized signature lists.--[If] Before a commission is
1  connected to the SURE system, if a commission uses digitized
2  signature lists as the district register, the original
3  registration cards shall be placed in exact alphabetical order
4  by last name of the registrant, indexed and kept at the office
5  of the commission in a manner as to be properly safeguarded.
6  These original cards constitute the general register of the
7  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
8  commission except upon order of a court of record. The
9  commission shall safely retain all registration cards used in
10  the registration of electors or in conducting an election. If a
11  commission has the capability to accept an electronic
12  application, the secretary may require the commission to produce
13  a computer-generated card to file in the general register. If
14  the commission finds a record for a registrant on the computer
15  data base which is not contained in the general register, it
16  shall replace the original card with a computer-generated
17  duplicate card upon written permission from the registrant or
18  upon order of a court of record.
19     (c)  Duplicate files.--[If] Before a commission is connected
20  to the SURE system, if the commission deems a duplicate file of
21  registration cards necessary for administrative purposes, the
22  commission may prepare a reproduction in compliance with the
23  following:
24         (1)  The registration form shall be photographed,
25     microphotographed or reproduced in a manner approved for
26     permanent records by the secretary.
27         (2)  The device used to reproduce the card is one which
28     accurately reproduces the original in all details.
29         (3)  The photographs, microphotographs or other
30     reproductions are open to public inspection and provision is
1     made for preserving, examining and using them.
2     (d)  General rule after connection.--After connection to the
3  SURE system, the data base of registrants appropriate to the
4  county maintained on the SURE system or the county data
5  processing facilities as selected by each commission in
6  accordance with section 322(c) shall constitute the general
7  register of the county and shall be used by the commission for
8  preparation of the district register. The data base for each
9  registrant shall contain all information of the registrant
10  required on the registration application, including his or her
11  signature, and suitable space for the insertion by the
12  appropriate official of the ward and election district of
13  residence, the registrant's street address, data required to be
14  given upon removal from the registrant's residence, the date of
15  each election at which the registrant votes, whether the
16  registrant is a Federal or State employee, an indication whether
17  the registrant needs assistance to vote and, if so, the nature
18  of the disability, and a unique identifier for all registrants
19  established by the secretary, except that identifying numbers
20  currently used by the counties shall also be maintained on the

27     1973gg et seq.).
28     (b)  Voter removal program.--
29         (1)  The [commission] secretary shall establish [a] the
30     following program to identify electors whose address may have
1     changed by establishing one of the following programs:
2             (i)  National change of address. The secretary shall
3         establish by regulation a program whereby information
4         supplied by the United States Postal Service through its
5         licensees is used on a periodic basis, but not less than
6         once every calendar year, to identify electors who may
7         have changed addresses. [The information shall be
8         incorporated in the SURE system and shall be forwarded to
9         the commissions in a manner determined by the secretary
10         by regulation.] The secretary shall purchase the
11         information from a licensee in accordance with
12         contracting procedures. The secretary shall conduct the
13         comparative search of names on the list against the SURE
14         data base and notify each county via the SURE system of
15         the change of address information including the date of
16         removal for those electors who should receive a notice
17         according to this section. The secretary shall be
18         responsible for covering all costs associated with the
19         national change of address program. Commissions that
20         maintain their county data base as the general register
21         pursuant to section 322(c)(2) may, at the county's
22         option, conduct the national change of address program
23         locally by contracting with a licensed vendor at county
24         expense.
25                 (A)  If it appears from the information provided
26             through the United States Postal Service that an
27             elector has moved to a different residence address
28             within the same county as the elector is currently
29             registered, the commission shall change the
30             registration records to show the new address and
1             shall send the elector, to the address recorded on
2             the elector's registration, a notice of the change of
3             address by forwardable mail and a postage prepaid,
4             preaddressed return form by which the elector may
5             verify or correct the address information.
6                 (B)  If it appears from the information provided
7             through the United States Postal Service that an
8             elector has moved to a different residence address
9             outside the county, the commission shall use the
10             notice procedure described in clause (A).
11             (ii)  Confirmation mailing:
12                 (A)  [A] In addition to using the program
13             specified in subparagraph (i), a commission may
14             establish a program by sending a direct,
15             nonforwardable first class "return if undeliverable -
16             address correction requested" mailing to all
17             registered electors in the county not marked inactive
18             in accordance with subsection (c).
19                 (B)  If this program is established, the
20             commission shall use the notice procedure described
21             in subparagraph (i)(A) and (B) for any elector whose
22             mailing is returned undeliverable.
23         (2)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
24     program established under paragraph (1), a canvass may be
25     used as follows:
26             (i)  The registration commission may, by
27         commissioners or by inspectors of registration, verify
28         the registration in an election district by visiting the
29         building from which an elector is registered and other
30         buildings as the commission deems necessary.
1             (ii)  The commission shall make a record of the name
2         and address of each registered elector who is found not
3         to reside at the registered address or who for any other
4         reason appears to be not qualified to vote in the
5         registered election district.
6             (iii)  The commission shall leave at the address of
7         each person referred to in subparagraph (ii) a notice
8         requiring him to communicate with the commission on or
9         before a date which the commission shall designate, and
10         which shall be not less than seven days and not more than
11         15 days from the date of the notice and in any case not
12         later than the 15th day preceding the election next
13         ensuing, and satisfy the commission of his qualifications
14         as an elector. The commission shall cause a confirmation
15         of each such notice to be sent by mail promptly to such
16         person at the address from which he is registered. The
17         envelope containing such information is to be plainly
18         marked that it is not to be forwarded. At the expiration
19         of the time specified in the notice, the commission shall
20         cancel the registration of such person who has not
21         communicated with the commission and proved his
22         qualifications as an elector.
23             (iv)  To facilitate the canvass under this section,
24         the commission may, when necessary, appoint special
25         inspectors of registration, in number not exceeding
26         double the number of election districts being canvassed.
27             (v)  Special inspectors must be qualified electors of
28         the county. They shall be appointed without reference to
29         residence in election districts or to political
30         affiliations or beliefs. The commission shall instruct
1         special inspectors in their duties. Special inspectors
2         have the powers conferred by this act upon inspectors of
3         registration.
4         (3)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
5     program established under paragraph (1), the commission shall
6     send a notice pursuant to subsection (d) to any elector who
7     has not voted nor appeared to vote during the period
8     beginning five years before the date of the notice and ending
9     on the date of the notice and for whom the board of elections
10     did not during that period in any other way receive any
11     information that the voter still resides in the registered
12     election district.
13         (4)  Commissions shall complete, not later than 90 days
14     before each [primary] election, at least once per year the
15     voter removal programs under this section and shall promptly
16     update information contained in its registration records.
17     This paragraph shall not be construed to preclude any of the
18     following:
19             (i)  Cancellation of an elector's registration as
20         provided for under subsection (a)(1) or (2).
21             (ii)  Correction of registration records in
22         accordance with this act.
23     (c)  Identification of inactive voters.--A commission shall
24  mark an "I" or "inactive" on the registration [card] record of
25  each elector who has been mailed a form under subsection (b)(1)
26  or (3) and has failed to respond[, which]. The registration
27  record of each registered elector classified as inactive shall
28  be included with all other registration [cards] records for that
29  polling site and located at the individual's polling site on the
30  day of the election but may be contained on a list separate from
1  electors not marked inactive.
2     (d)  Cancellation of registration.--
3         (1)  A commission shall not cancel the registration of an
4     elector on the ground that the elector has changed residence

13             necessary, corrected the commission's record of the
14             elector's address, in an election during the period
15             beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the

19         (2)  A notice, as required in paragraph (1)(ii), is
20     acceptable if it is a postage prepaid and preaddressed return
21     card, sent by forwardable mail, on which the elector may
22     state the elector's current address, if it contains a notice
23     as follows:
24             (i)  The notice must state all of the following:
25                 (A)  If the elector did not change residence or

27             the elector must return the card not later than 30
28             days prior to the next election. If the card is not
29             returned, affirmation or confirmation of the
