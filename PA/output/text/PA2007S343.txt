19                     ELECTION DAY REGISTRATION
20  Section 301.  Election day registration.
21     (a)  General rule.--Any person otherwise eligible to vote may
22  register to vote on the day of any primary, municipal or general
23  election by appearing in person at the polling place for the
24  election district in which the individual maintains residence,
25  completing a registration card, making an oath in the form
26  prescribed by the department and providing proof of residence.
27     (b)  Proof of residence.--An individual may prove residence
28  by any of the following methods:
29         (1)  By displaying a valid driver's license.
30         (2)  By showing any document approved by the department.
1         (3)  By the written statement of an elector registered to
2     vote in that election district, sworn to in the presence of a
3     judge of elections, stating to the effect that the elector
4     personally knows that the individual is a resident of the
5     election district. An individual whose residence has been
6     sworn to under this paragraph on election day may not sign a
7     proof of residence oath for any other individual on that
8     election day.
9  Section 302.  Procedure.
10     (a)  Judges of elections.--Voter registration under this act
11  shall be conducted by judges of elections. A judge who registers
12  an individual voter shall not process that voter's ballot at any
13  time prior to opening of the ballot box after the voting ends.
14     (b)  Registration cards.--Registration cards and forms for
15  oaths shall be available at each polling place. If an individual
16  who registers on election day proves residence under section
17  301(b)(3), the form containing that statement shall be attached
18  to the individual's registration card. Registration cards
19  completed on election day shall be forwarded to the appropriate
20  county board, which shall add the name of each voter to the
21  registration rolls unless the information forwarded is
22  substantially deficient. Each judge of elections registering a
23  person on election day shall initial the voter registration card
24  of that person.
25     (c)  Deficient registration.--A county board that finds an
26  election day registration substantially deficient shall mail
27  written notice of same to the individual. An election day
28  registration shall not be found deficient solely because the
29  individual who provided proof of residence was ineligible to do
30  so.
1  Section 303.  Maps.
2     The county board shall provide each polling place with a
3  detailed map showing election districts in order to assist
4  judges of elections in determining whether an address is located
5  in that district.
6  Section 304.  Record of attempted registrations.
7     The judge of elections responsible for election day
8  registration at each polling place shall keep a record of the
9  number of individuals who attempt to register on election day
10  but who cannot provide proof of residence as required by this
11  act. This record shall be forwarded to the county board with the
12  election returns for that election district.
13  Section 305.  Verification by mail.
14     Within ten days of an election, each county board shall send
15  a notice to a random sampling of no less than 25% of individuals
16  registered on election day. The random sampling shall be
17  determined in accordance with the rules of the department. As
18  soon as practicable after the election, the board shall mail
19  registration verification notices to all individuals registered
20  on election day. If a notice is returned as not deliverable, the
21  board shall attempt to determine the reason for the return. A
22  county board which does not receive or obtain satisfactory proof
23  of an individual's eligibility to vote shall immediately notify
24  the district attorney and the department.
25                             CHAPTER 5
26                     ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES
27  Section 501.  Prohibited acts.
28     (a)  Offenses enumerated.--It shall be unlawful:
29         (1)  To cause an individual's name to be registered in
30     any election district if that individual is not eligible to
1     vote.
2         (2)  To cause an individual's name to be registered for
3     the purpose of voting in more than one election district or
4     in any election district in which the individual does not
5     maintain residence.
6         (3)  To misrepresent an individual's identity when
7     attempting to register to vote.
8         (4)  To aid, abet, counsel or procure any other
9     individual to violate this act.
10         (5)  For a judge of elections to allow an unregistered
11     voter to vote in any election.
12     (b)  Grading.--A violation of this section constitutes a
13  misdemeanor of the second degree.
14  Section 502.  Enforcement.
15     Prosecution for violations of this act shall be brought by
16  the district attorney, upon information supplied by the
17  department, a county election officer or any person.
