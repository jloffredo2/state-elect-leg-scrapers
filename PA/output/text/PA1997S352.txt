17     Section 1.  Section 1622 of the act of June 3, 1937
18  (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code,
19  amended or added October 4, 1978 (P.L.893, No.171) and July 11,
20  1980 (P.L.591, No.127), is amended to read:
21     Section 1622.  Organization of Political Committees;
22  Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer; Records of Candidate and
23  Committees.--
1     (a)  Only one (1) candidate's political committee may be
2  formed on behalf of a specified candidate and authorized by that
3  candidate to receive and disburse funds on behalf of his
4  candidacy. The staff of the candidate's political committee so
5  formed shall not be shared with any other candidate's political
6  committee, nor shall it share its staff with or utilize the
7  staff of any political action committee.
8     (a.1)  Every political committee shall have a treasurer and a
9  chairman. No contribution shall be received nor shall any
10  expenditure be made when there is a vacancy in either one of
11  these offices. All money received and disbursed by a political
12  committee must be done through the treasurer of the committee.
13     (b)  [Every candidate who authorizes a committee or
14  committees, to receive and disburse funds on behalf of this
15  candidacy, shall name a sole treasurer, irrespective of the
16  number of committees so authorized, to receive and disburse all
17  funds for said committees.] Nothing herein shall be construed to
18  prohibit a candidate from receiving or expending moneys on his
19  behalf or a treasurer of a political party committee or a
20  committee authorized to receive and distribute funds on behalf
21  of more than one (1) candidate from receiving or expending
22  moneys on behalf of said candidates, notwithstanding the
23  appointment of a sole treasurer. A sole treasurer may delegate
24  authority, in writing, to any number of assistant treasurers to
25  receive and disburse moneys collected on behalf of a candidate
26  for election. Nothing in this section shall prohibit authorized
27  individuals from selling tickets or soliciting funds when funds
28  are deposited in the campaign account of the candidate.
29     (c)  Each candidate and committee shall keep records of the
30  names and addresses of each person from whom a contribution of
1  over ten dollars ($10) has been received and a record of all
2  other information required to be reported pursuant to this act.
3  All such records shall be retained by the candidate or treasurer
4  for a period of three (3) years after such information is
5  reported as required by this act.
6     (d)  Any person receiving any contribution on behalf of a
7  political committee or candidate shall turn such contributions
8  over to the treasurer of that committee or the candidate within
9  ten (10) days of its receipt.
10     Section 2.  The act is amended by adding sections to read:
11     Section 1625.1.  Political Action Committees.--
12     (a)  Any political action committee which has given a
13  contribution or pledge, regardless of amount, to any candidate
14  shall be subject to the same registration and reporting
15  provisions as are political committees.
16     (b)  The registration statement required by section 1624
17  shall be filed by a political action committee which has given a
18  contribution or pledge, regardless of amount, to any candidate.
19     (c)  Upon registration, each political action committee shall
20  be assigned a registration number and shall enter that number,
21  together with the full name of the political action committee
22  and any acronym it may use, on all subsequent reports.
23     (d)  The registration form for a political action committee
24  shall include a clear and precise statement by the political
25  action committee of the interests it represents, together with
26  the names, addresses and relationships of other affiliated or
27  connected organizations.
28     (e)  Any given organization, together with its affiliated or
29  connected organizations, shall be limited to one (1) political
30  action committee.
1     (f)  One (1) political action committee shall not share a
2  staff with another political action committee, nor shall any
3  person be an officer of more than one (1) political action
4  committee.

26     (f)  A gift, subscription, loan, advance or deposit of money
27  or anything of value to a candidate shall be considered a
28  contribution both by the original source of the contribution and
29  by any intermediary or conduit if the intermediary or conduit:
30     (1)  exercises any control or any direction over the making
1  of the contribution; or
2     (2)  solicits the contribution or arranges for the
3  contribution to be made and directly or indirectly makes the
4  candidate aware of such intermediary's or conduit's role in
5  soliciting or arranging the contribution for such candidate.
6     (g)  For purposes of subsection (f), a contribution shall not
7  be considered to be a contribution by an intermediary or conduit
8  to the candidate if:

10  candidate's committee for the purpose of fundraising and is
11  reimbursed for expenses incurred in soliciting contributions;
12     (2)  in the case of an individual, the candidate has
13  expressly authorized the intermediary or conduit to engage in
14  fundraising or the individual occupies a significant position
15  within the candidate's campaign organization; or
16     (3)  in the case of a political committee, the intermediary
17  or conduit is an authorized committee of the candidate.
