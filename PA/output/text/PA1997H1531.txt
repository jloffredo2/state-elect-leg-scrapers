30  whether in uniform or in citizen's clothes, shall be within one
1  hundred feet of a polling place during the conduct of any

8  and such police officers must be within one hundred (100) feet
9  of the polling place to enter and exit such police station or

13  or overawe any elector or prevent him from voting or restrain
14  his freedom of choice, nor may any such police officer
15  electioneer or directly or indirectly attempt to influence the
16  election or electors while within one hundred (100) feet of a
17  polling place as herein set forth: And provided further, That
18  where polling places are located in buildings or on premises
19  where a police station or headquarters are located, the polling

25  prevented from exercising the right of suffrage in the election
26  district in which he resides, if otherwise qualified.
27     Section 3.  This act shall take effect immediately.
