26     (b)  Decision.--
27         (1)  If the commission finds the official registration
28     application not properly completed, the application shall be
29     rejected. The commission should make reasonable efforts to
30     complete the registration before rejecting it for omissions
1     and inconsistencies. If the commission rejects an application
2     under this paragraph, it shall indicate "REJECTED" on the
3     application and state there the reason for rejection and
4     notify the applicant by first class nonforwardable mail,
5     return postage guaranteed. Rejected registration applications
6     filed electronically shall be preserved on the integrated

13     the commission shall mail to the applicant a voter's
14     identification card in accordance with subsection (d)(1).
15         (3)  For an application for a transfer of registration or

17     required information and the applicant is legally qualified
18     to transfer registration or change name or address as stated
19     in the application, the commission shall make the transfer or
20     change. If the commission suspects that the applicant is not
21     entitled to transfer registration or to change name or
22     address, the commission may investigate. If the commission
23     finds that the applicant is not entitled to the transfer or
24     change, the application shall be rejected. The applicant
25     shall be notified of the rejection and the reason for it.
26     Rejection shall be made no later than ten days before the
27     election succeeding the filing of the application.
28     (c)  Result.--[If an] Until such time as the commission is
29  able to use the registry for the administration of voter
30  registration pursuant to this act, if a voter registration
1  application is designed to serve as a registration card, the
2  accepted application of an elector may serve as the elector's
3  official registration card, if it was so designed, and shall be
4  filed in the office of the commission in accordance with Chapter
5  7. If the application is not designed to serve as a registration
6  card, the information contained on the application, including
7  the elector's signature, shall be transferred to the
8  registration card. If a commission utilizes a signature
9  digitization list, it shall transfer all information contained
10  on the application, including the signature, to the registry or,
11  until the registry is established, to a computer file. Once the
12  commission is connected to the integrated voter registration
13  system, the information contained on an approved voter
14  registration application including the elector's signature shall
15  be transferred to the registry. If the approved application has
16  been submitted electronically, the commission shall make it a
17  permanent record of the registry and print a paper copy and
18  process it according to section 702(b)(1). Applicants for
19  registration shall be challenged under section 529.

21  Section 701.  General register.
22     [(a)  Original registration cards.--If a commission uses the

24  county as the district register, the duplicate registration
25  cards or photocopies of the original registration cards shall be
26  placed in exact alphabetical order by last name of the
27  registrant, shall be indexed and shall be kept at the office of
28  the registration commission in a manner as to be properly
29  safeguarded. These cards constitute the general register of the
30  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
1  commission except upon order of a court of record. Nothing in
2  this act shall preclude the use of duplicate registration cards
3  from applications provided under the act of March 30, 1937
4  (P.L.115, No.40), known as The First Class City Permanent
5  Registration Act, or the act of April 29, 1937 (P.L.487,

13  of the commission in a manner as to be properly safeguarded.
14  These original cards constitute the general register of the
15  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
16  commission except upon order of a court of record. The
17  commission shall safely retain all registration cards used in
18  the registration of electors or in conducting an election. If a
19  commission has the capability to accept an electronic
20  application, the secretary may require the commission to produce
21  a computer-generated card to file in the general register. If
22  the commission finds a record for a registrant on the computer
23  data base which is not contained in the general register, it
24  shall replace the original card with a computer-generated
25  duplicate card upon written permission from the registrant or
26  upon order of a court of record.
27     (c)  Duplicate files.--If the commission deems a duplicate
28  file of registration cards necessary for administrative
29  purposes, the commission may prepare a reproduction in

4     (b)  Voter removal program.--
5         (1)  The [commission] secretary shall establish [a] the
6     following program to identify electors whose address may have
7     changed by establishing one of the following programs:
8             (i)  National change of address. The secretary shall
9         establish by regulation a program whereby information
10         supplied by the United States Postal Service through its
11         licensees is used on a periodic basis, but not less than
12         once every calendar year, to identify electors who may
13         have changed addresses. [The information shall be
14         incorporated in the administration of the Statewide
15         central registry and shall be forwarded to the
16         commissions in a manner determined by the secretary by
17         regulation.] The secretary shall purchase the information
18         from a licensee in accordance with contracting
19         procedures. The secretary shall conduct the comparative
20         search of names on the list against registered electors
21         not marked inactive in accordance with subsection (c) and
22         the registry at least once every year and notify each
23         county via the integrated voter registration system of
24         those electors who should receive a notice specified in
25         clause (A). The secretary shall be responsible for
26         covering all costs associated with the national change of
27         address program.
28                 (A)  If it appears from the information provided
29             through the United States Postal Service that an
30             elector has moved to a different residence address
1             within the same county as the elector is currently
2             registered, the commission shall change the
3             registration records to show the new address and
4             shall send the elector, to the address recorded on
5             the elector's registration, a notice of the change of
6             address by forwardable mail and a postage prepaid,
7             preaddressed return form by which the elector may
8             verify or correct the address information.
9                 (B)  If it appears from the information provided
10             through the United States Postal Service that an
11             elector has moved to a different residence address
12             outside the county, the commission shall use the
13             notice procedure described in clause (A).
14             (ii)  Confirmation mailing:
15                 (A)  [A] In addition to using the programs
16             specified in subparagraph (i), a commission may
17             establish a program by sending a direct,
18             nonforwardable first class "return if undeliverable -
19             address correction requested" mailing to all
20             registered electors in the county not marked as
21             inactive in accordance with subsection (c) at least
22             once every five years.
23                 (B)  If this program is established, the
24             commission shall use the notice procedure described
25             in subparagraph (i)(A) for any elector whose mailing
26             is returned undeliverable.
27         (2)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
28     program established under paragraph (1), a canvass may be
29     used as follows:
30             (i)  The registration commission may, by
1         commissioners or by inspectors of registration, verify
2         the registration in an election district by visiting the
3         building from which an elector is registered and other
4         buildings as the commission deems necessary.
5             (ii)  The commission shall make a record of the name
6         and address of each registered elector who is found not
7         to reside at the registered address or who for any other
8         reason appears to be not qualified to vote in the
9         registered election district.
10             (iii)  The commission shall leave at the address of
11         each person referred to in subparagraph (ii) a notice
12         requiring him to communicate with the commission on or
13         before a date which the commission shall designate, and
14         which shall be not less than seven days and not more than
15         15 days from the date of the notice and in any case not
16         later than the 15th day preceding the election next
17         ensuing, and satisfy the commission of his qualifications
18         as an elector. The commission shall cause a confirmation
19         of each such notice to be sent by mail promptly to such
20         person at the address from which he is registered. The
21         envelope containing such information is to be plainly
22         marked that it is not to be forwarded. At the expiration
23         of the time specified in the notice, the commission shall
24         cancel the registration of such person who has not
25         communicated with the commission and proved his
26         qualifications as an elector.
27             (iv)  To facilitate the canvass under this section,
28         the commission may, when necessary, appoint special
29         inspectors of registration, in number not exceeding
30         double the number of election districts being canvassed.
1             (v)  Special inspectors must be qualified electors of
2         the county. They shall be appointed without reference to
3         residence in election districts or to political
4         affiliations or beliefs. The commission shall instruct
5         special inspectors in their duties. Special inspectors
6         have the powers conferred by this act upon inspectors of
7         registration.
8         (3)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
9     program established under paragraph (1), the commission shall
10     send a notice pursuant to subsection (d) to any elector who
11     has not voted nor appeared to vote during the period
12     beginning five years before the date of the notice and ending
13     on the date of the notice and for whom the board of elections
14     did not during that period in any other way receive any
15     information that the voter still resides in the registered
16     election district.
17         (4)  [Commissions] The secretary and commissions shall
18     complete, not later than 90 days before each primary[, at
19     least once per year] or election, the voter removal programs
20     under this section. This paragraph shall not be construed to
21     preclude any of the following:
22             (i)  Cancellation of an elector's registration as
23         provided for under subsection (a)(1) or (2).
24             (ii)  Correction of registration records in
25         accordance with this act.
26     (c)  Identification of inactive voters.--A commission shall
27  mark an "I" or "inactive" on the registration card of each
28  elector who has been mailed a form under subsection (b)(1) or
29  (3) and has failed to respond[, which]. The registration record
30  of each registered elector classified as inactive shall be
1  included with all other registration cards for that polling site
2  and located at the individual's polling site on the day of the
3  election but may be contained on a list separate from electors
4  not marked inactive.
