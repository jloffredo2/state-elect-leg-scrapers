2  on the day of each primary and election from 7 o'clock A. M.
3  until 10 o'clock P. M. and so long thereafter as it may appear
4  that the process of said court will be necessary to secure a
5  free, fair and correct computation and canvass of the votes cast
6  at said election. In judicial districts having but one judge of
7  the court of common pleas, such judge shall not be required to
8  be in session, as aforesaid, between the hours of 12 o'clock
9  noon and 2 o'clock P. M., nor between the hours of 5:30 o'clock
10  P. M. and 7 o'clock P. M. During such period said court shall

13  respect to the conduct of the election; shall issue process, if
14  necessary, to enforce and secure compliance with the election

18  "Pennsylvania Voter Registration Act"; and [in counties of the
19  third class] shall have power to appoint additional clerks at
20  the polling places where needed and requested by the election
21  board: Provided, That for each clerk appointed from the majority
22  political party, a clerk from the minority political party must
23  also be appointed. In addition, said court shall hear and
24  determine the petition of any qualified elector who has
25  heretofore been duly registered as an elector of said county but
26  who, due to circumstances beyond his control, has failed to file
27  a removal notice or reinstatement card in order to insure the
28  inclusion of the elector's registration card in the district
29  register of the election district of the elector's residence;
30  the petition of any qualified registered elector who has
1  suffered a physical disability which renders the elector unable
2  to see or mark the ballot or operate the voting machine or to
3  enter the voting machine compartment or voting booth without
4  assistance and, due to circumstances beyond the elector's
5  control, was unable to make application personally at the office
6  of the registration commission within the time prescribed by law
7  in order to have such fact entered on the elector's registration
8  card; the petition of any qualified elector who is a duly
9  discharged veteran and who, by reason of the elector's service

18     Section 1210.  Manner of Applying to Vote; Persons Entitled
19  to Vote; Voter's Certificates; Entries to Be Made in District
20  Register; Numbered Lists of Voters; Challenges.--(a)  At every
21  primary and election each elector who desires to vote shall
22  first sign a voter's certificate, and, unless [he] the elector
23  is a State or Federal employe who has registered under any
24  registration act without declaring [his] a residence by street
25  and number, [he] the elector shall insert his address therein,
26  unless the commission shall have it printed on the voter's
27  certificate, and hand the same to the election officer in charge
28  of the district register. Such election officer shall thereupon
29  announce the elector's name so that it may be heard by all
30  members of the election board and by all watchers present in the
1  polling place and shall compare the elector's signature on [his]
2  the elector's voter's certificate with [his] the elector's
3  signature in the district register. If, upon such comparison,
4  the signature upon the voter's certificate appears to be
5  genuine, the elector who has signed the certificate shall, if
6  otherwise qualified, be permitted to vote: Provided, That if the
7  signature on the voter's certificate, as compared with the
8  signature as recorded in the district register, shall not be
9  deemed authentic by any of the election officers, such elector
10  shall not be denied the right to vote for that reason, but shall
11  be considered challenged as to identity and required to make the
12  affidavit and produce the evidence as provided in subsection (d)
13  of this section. When an elector has been found entitled to
14  vote, the election officer who examined [his] the voter's
15  certificate and compared [his] the elector's signature shall
16  sign [his] the officer's name or initials on the voter's
17  certificate, and shall, if the elector's signature is not
18  readily legible, print such elector's name over [his] the
19  elector's signature, and the number of the stub of the ballot
20  issued to [him or his] the elector's number in the order of
21  admission to the voting machines, and at primaries a letter or
22  abbreviation designating the party in whose primary [he] the
23  elector votes shall also be entered by one of the election
24  officers or clerks. As each [voter] elector is found to be
25  qualified and votes, the election officer in charge of the
26  district register shall write or stamp the date of the election
27  or primary, the number of the stub of the ballot issued to [him]
28  the elector or [his] the elector's number in the order of
29  admission to the voting machines, and at primaries a letter or
30  abbreviation designating the party in whose primary [he] the
1  elector votes, and shall sign [his] the election officer's name
2  or initials in the proper space on the registration card of such
3  [voter] elector contained in the district register or next to
4  the elector's signature on a computer-generated list or
5  digitized signature list with voter's certificates thereon, if
6  either is utilized by the county.
7     As each [voter] elector votes, [his] the elector's name in
8  the order of voting shall be recorded in two (2) numbered lists
9  of [voters] electors provided for that purpose, with the
10  addition of a note of each [voter's] elector's party enrollment
11  after [his] the elector's name at primaries.
12     * * *
13     (d)  No person, except a qualified elector who is in actual
14  military or naval service under a requisition of the President
15  of the United States or by the authority of this Commonwealth,
16  and who votes under the provisions of Article XIII of this act,
17  shall be entitled or permitted to vote at any primary or
18  election at any polling place outside the election district in
19  which [he] the person resides, nor shall [he] the person be
20  permitted to vote in the election district in which [he] the
21  person resides, unless [he] the person has been personally
22  registered as an elector and [his] the elector's registration
23  card appears in the district register of such election district,
24  except by order of the court of common pleas as provided in this
25  act, and any person, although personally registered as an
26  elector, may be challenged by any qualified elector, election
27  officer, overseer, or watcher at any primary or election as to
28  [his] the person's identity, [as to his] continued residence in
29  the election district or [as to] any alleged violation of the
30  provisions of section 1210 of this act, and if challenged as to
1  identity or residence, [he] the person shall produce at least
2  one qualified elector of the election district as a witness, who
3  shall make affidavit of [his] the challenged elector's identity
4  or continued residence in the election district[: Provided,
5  however, That no person shall be entitled to vote as a member of
6  a party at any primary, unless he is registered and enrolled as
7  a member of such party upon the district register, which
8  enrollment shall be conclusive as to his party membership and
9  shall not be subject to challenge on the day of the primary].
10     (e)  An elector who is registered and enrolled as a member of
11  a political party, and who, upon applying to vote, shall have
12  established his identity by signing his name and address, or
13  otherwise, as herein required at elections, and is otherwise
14  qualified, may vote as a member of such party at any primary
15  succeeding the elector's registration without being subject to
16  any challenge regarding the elector's party membership. No
17  elector registered and enrolled as a member of a political party
18  shall be allowed to receive or vote the ballot of any other
19  political party at any primary election.
20     (f)  A registered qualified elector, although not enrolled as
21  a member of a political party, shall be permitted to vote at a
22  primary on questions and other matters not involving the
23  nomination of political party candidates or the election of
24  political party officers or delegates.
25     (g)  If an elector's registration record indicates that the
26  elector is in an inactive status, the elector shall be entitled
27  to vote as provided by section 1902 of the act of June 30, 1995
28  (P.L.170, No.25), known as the "Pennsylvania Voter Registration
29  Act."
30     Section 11 14.  The act is amended by adding sections to       <--
1  read:
2     Section 1210.1.  Procedure for Voting Following Failure to
3  Return Notification Card.--(a)  A registered elector who has
4  moved to an address within the same election district where the
5  elector is registered shall, notwithstanding failure to notify
6  the commission prior to the date of an election, be permitted to
7  vote in that election district upon written affirmation by the
8  elector of the change of address before an election official at
9  the election district polling place.
10     (b)  A registered elector who has moved to an address within
11  a different election district of the county where the elector is
12  registered and who has failed to notify the commission of the
13  change of address prior to the date of an election shall be
14  permitted to notify the registration commission of the address
15  change and vote at the elector's former polling place upon
16  written affirmation by the elector of the new address before an
17  election official at the former polling place.
18     (c)  A registered elector who has moved to another county and
19  who has failed to notify any commission of the change of address
20  prior to the date of the election shall be permitted to notify
21  the registration commission of the address change and vote at
22  the elector's former polling place upon written affirmation by
23  the elector of the new address before an election official at
24  the former polling place.
25     Section 1210.2.  Incorrect Records.--If voter registration
26  records incorrectly indicate that an elector has moved from an
27  address in the election district where the elector is
28  registered, the elector shall, upon written affirmation of the
29  error before an election official at the polling place within
30  said election district, be permitted to vote at that polling
1  place.
2     Section 12 15.  Section 1212 of the act is amended to read:    <--
3     Section 1212.  Voting Check List.--[After each elector has
4  been admitted to vote, his voter's certificate shall be inserted
5  in the file or binder provided therefor by the county board, and
6  known as the "Voting Check List," and the said voter's
7  certificate so bound] The "Voting Check List" shall consist of
8  the collection of the voter's certificates of those electors
9  whose admission to vote is evidenced on said certificates by the
10  signature or initials of a district election official. The
11  Voting Check List shall constitute the official list of electors
12  voting at [such] each primary or election. [All] If the county
13  uses digitized signature lists containing voter's certificates
14  thereon as a district register or computer-generated lists, said
15  lists shall constitute the Voting Check List for said county. If
16  the voter's certificates do not appear on digitized signature
17  lists used as district registers or on computer-generated lists,
18  the electors' voter's certificates shall be inserted in the file
19  or binder provided therefor by the county board after each
20  elector has been admitted to vote. The voter's certificates
21  [prepared by persons applying to vote] of electors whose
22  applications to vote are refused by the election officer shall
23  be carefully preserved and returned by the election officer to
24  the county board with the other papers.
25     Section 13 16.  Section 1218 of the act, amended February 13,  <--
26  1989 (P.L.1, No.1), is amended to read:
27     Section 1218.  Assistance in Voting.--
28     (a)  No [voter] elector shall be permitted to receive any
29  assistance in voting at any primary or election, unless there is
30  recorded upon [his] such elector's registration card [his
1  declaration] a declaration, or unless the elector declares in
2  writing at the polling place, that, by reason of blindness,
3  disability, or inability to read or write, [he] the elector is
4  unable to read the names on the ballot or on the voting machine
5  labels, or that [he] the elector has a physical disability which
6  renders [him] such elector unable to see or mark the ballot or
7  operate the voting machine, or to enter the voting compartment
8  or voting machine booth without assistance, the exact nature of
9  such condition being recorded on such registration card or
10  declaration, and unless the election officers are satisfied that
11  [he] the elector still suffers from the same condition. The
12  declaration completed in the polling place shall be in a form
13  approved by the Secretary of the Commonwealth substantially as
14  follows:
15             I, .......................................
16         (Name and address of elector requiring assistance)
17             by reason of .............................
18                  (Reason for need of assistance)
19            am unable to vote without the assistance of

23            Witnessed by ..............................
24                  (Signature of Judge of Election)
25     (b)  Any elector who is entitled to receive assistance in
26  voting under the provisions of this section shall be permitted
27  by the judge of election to select a person of the elector's
28  choice to enter the voting compartment or voting machine booth
29  with [him] the elector to assist [him] the elector in voting,
30  such assistance to be rendered inside the voting compartment or
1  voting machine booth except that the elector's employer or an
2  agent of the employer or an officer or agent of the elector's
3  union shall not be eligible to assist the elector.
4     (c)  In every case of assistance under the provisions of this
5  section, the judge of election shall forthwith enter in writing
6  in a book to be furnished by the county board of elections, to
7  be known as the record of assisted voters--(1) the [voter's]
8  elector's name; (2) a statement of the facts which entitle [him]
9  the elector to receive assistance; and (3) the name of the
10  person furnishing the assistance. The record of assisted voters
11  shall be returned by the judge of election to the county board
12  of elections with the other papers, as hereinafter provided, and
13  said county board shall permit the same to be examined only upon
14  the written order of a judge of the court of common pleas:
15  Provided, however, That such record shall be subject to subpoena
16  to the same extent to which other election records may be
17  subpoenaed: And provided further, That the county election board
18  shall permit any registration commission to examine any records
19  of assisted voters without a court order, in order that the
20  registration commission may ascertain whether electors, who have
21  declared, at the time of registration, their need for
22  assistance, actually did receive assistance when voting at any
23  election or primary.
24     (d)  Subsequent to the election or primary, the county board
25  of elections shall record or cause to be recorded the facts of
26  the declaration completed in the polling place as prescribed by
27  subsection (a) onto the elector's registration card including
28  the reason the elector requires assistance.

24  act, amended December 11, 1968 (P.L.1183, No.375), are amended
25  to read:
26     Section 1302.2.  Approval of Application for Absentee
27  Ballot.--
28     * * *
29     (c) The county board of elections, upon receipt of any
30  application of a qualified elector required to be registered
1  under the provisions of preceding section 1301, shall determine
2  the qualifications of such applicant by comparing the
3  information set forth on such application with the information
4  contained on the applicant's permanent registration card. If the
5  board is satisfied that the applicant is qualified to receive an
6  official absentee ballot, the application shall be marked
7  "approved." Such approval decision shall be final and binding,
8  except that challenges may be made only on the ground that the
9  applicant did not possess the qualifications of an absentee
10  elector. Such challenges must be made to the county board of
11  elections within twenty-four hours of the deadline for filing
12  said applications prior to [5:00 o'clock P. M. on the first
13  Friday prior to] the election. When so approved, the
14  registration commission shall cause an absentee [voter's]
15  elector's temporary registration card to be inserted in the
16  district register on top of and along with the permanent
17  registration card. The absentee [voter's] elector's temporary
18  registration card shall be in the color and form prescribed in
19  subsection (e) of this section:
20     Provided, however, That the duties of the county boards of
21  elections and the registration commissions with respect to the
22  insertion of the absentee [voter's] elector's temporary
23  registration card of any elector from the district register as
24  set forth in section 1302.2 shall include only such applications
25  and emergency applications as are received on or before the
26  first Tuesday prior to the primary or election. In all cases
27  where applications are received after the first Tuesday prior to
28  the primary or election and before [five o'clock P. M. on the
29  first Friday] the close of business on the first Monday
30  immediately prior to the primary or election, the county board
1  of elections shall determine the qualifications of such
2  applicant by comparing the information set forth on such
3  application with the information contained on the applicant's
4  [duplicate] registration card on file in the General Register
5  (also referred to as the Master File) in the office of the
6  Registration Commission and shall cause the name and residence
7  (and at primaries, the party enrollment) to be inserted in the
8  Military, Veterans and Emergency Civilian Absentee Voters File
9  as provided in section 1302.3, subsection (b). In addition, the
10  local district boards of elections shall, upon canvassing the
11  official absentee ballots under section 1308, examine the voting
12  check list of the election district of said elector's residence
13  and satisfy itself that such elector did not cast any ballot
14  other than the one properly issued to [him] the elector under
15  [his] the elector's absentee ballot application. In all cases
16  where the examination of the local district board of elections
17  discloses that an elector did vote a ballot other than the one
18  properly issued to [him] the elector under the absentee ballot
19  application, the local district board of elections shall
20  thereupon cancel said absentee ballot and said elector shall be
21  subject to the penalties as hereinafter set forth.
22     * * *
23     (e) The absentee [voter's] elector's temporary registration
24  card shall be in duplicate and the same size as the permanent
25  registration card, in a different and contrasting color to the
26  permanent registration card and shall contain the absentee
27  [voter's] elector's name and address and shall conspicuously
28  contain the words "Absentee [Voter] Elector." Such card shall
29  also contain the affidavit required by subsection (b) of section
30  1306[.]: Provided, however, That counties utilizing digitized
1  signature lists as district registers shall utilize such lists
2  or computer-generated forms as temporary registration cards.
3  Such lists or printouts shall contain the same information and
4  affidavit as required by this section. The elector's signature
5  in the district register shall void an absentee ballot
6  previously filed by the elector in that election.
7     Section 1302.3.  Absentee Electors Files and Lists.--(a) The
8  county board of elections shall maintain at its office a file
9  containing the duplicate absentee voter's temporary registration
10  cards of every registered elector to whom an absentee ballot has
11  been sent. Such duplicate absentee voter's temporary
12  registration cards shall be filed by election districts and
13  within each election district in exact alphabetical order and
14  indexed. The registration cards so filed shall constitute the
15  Registered Absentee Voters File for the Primary or Election of
16  (date of primary or election) and shall be kept on file for a
17  period commencing the Tuesday prior to the day of the primary or
18  election until the day following the primary or election or the
19  day the county board of elections certifies the returns of the
20  primary or election, whichever date is later. Such file shall be
21  open to public inspection, upon written request and at all times
22  subject to reasonable safeguards, rules and regulations.
23     (b) The county board of elections shall [post in a
24  conspicuous public place at its office] make available upon
25  written request a master list arranged in alphabetical order by
26  election districts setting forth the name and residence, and at
27  primaries, the party enrollment, of (1) every military elector
28  to whom an absentee ballot is being sent, each such name to be
29  prefixed with an "M"; (2) every bedridden or hospitalized
