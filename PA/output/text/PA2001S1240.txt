12             (ii)  In the case of changes of address received by
13         the Department of Transportation which do not contain a
14         signature of the registrant, the commission receiving the
15         change of address notification shall mail a notice to the
16         registrant at the new residence address requesting
17         verification of the address change. If the change of
18         address is to a new residence outside the commission's
19         jurisdiction, the commission shall mail the following
20         notice:
21         Date................
22               Office of the Registration Commission
23                  .......... County, Pennsylvania
24           ........ (Address and Telephone No. of County)
25         We have been notified by the Department of Transportation
26         that you recently changed your address from
27         ................. (old residence address) to
28         ............... (new residence address) and that this
29         change of address is to serve as a change of address for
30         voter registration purposes. Unless you notify this
1         office within ten days from the date of this notice that
2         this information is not correct, your voter registration
3         will be transferred to ........... County. You may notify
4         this office by writing your residence address, the date
5         and your signature on the bottom of this form and mailing
6         this notice to this office. You need not notify this
7         office if this information is correct.
8                                 ............................
9                                                Chief Clerk
10         If the address change is within the commission's
11         jurisdiction, the [county] commission shall mail a
12         voter's identification card to the registrant at the new
13         residence address.
14             (iii)  If the registrant does not return the notice
15         under subparagraph (ii) within the ten-day period, the
16         commission shall process the change of address according
17         to subparagraph (i). If the registrant notifies the
18         commission that the information is incorrect and the
19         commission is satisfied with the registrant's explanation
20         of the discrepancy, the address of the registrant's
21         registration shall remain unchanged. If the verification
22         notification or voter identification card is returned by
23         the post office as undeliverable as addressed or with a
24         forwarding address, the commission shall send a
25         confirmation notice to the registrant's address of former
26         residence in accordance with section 1901(d)(2).
27         (5)  Upon notification and confirmation of any change of
28     address, a commission shall promptly update information
29     contained in its registration record.

6  registration may be submitted by voter registration mail
7  application in the manner set forth in this section. An
8  application may be submitted by mail or by representative to the
9  [registration] commission on an official mail registration
10  application, the form of which shall be determined and
11  prescribed by the secretary or the Federal Election Commission
12  pursuant to the National Voter Registration Act (Public Law 103-

5     registered at the time the military elector would have been
6     entitled to register had the military elector not left that
7     home address but continued to reside there.
8         (3)  The commission is authorized to consider a request
9     for an absentee ballot as a request for an official

18         (5)  The right to be registered pursuant to this

30     Section 10.  Section 528 of the act, amended June 25, 2001
1  (P.L.674, No.61), is amended to read:
2  Section 528.  Approval of registration applications.
3     [(a)  Examination.--
4         (1)  Official registration applications submitted to a
5     registration commission shall be examined by the commissioner
6     or a clerk or registrar upon receipt.
7         (2)  If the official voter registration application
8     submission is in person, the application shall be attested
9     and dated by the commissioner, clerk or registrar.
10         (3)  Upon receipt of any other voter registration
11     application, the commission shall make an entry of the date
12     received on the application. If the applicant does not reside
13     within the commission's county but resides elsewhere in this
14     Commonwealth, the commission shall forward the application
15     card to the proper commission and make a record of the
16     forwarding.
17     (b)  Decision.--
18         (1)  If the commission finds the official registration
19     application not properly completed, the application shall be
20     rejected. The commission should make reasonable efforts to
21     complete the registration before rejecting it for omissions
22     and inconsistencies. If the commission rejects an application
23     under this paragraph, it shall indicate "REJECTED" on the
24     application and state there the reason for rejection and
25     notify the applicant by first class nonforwardable mail,
26     return postage guaranteed.
27         (2)  If the official registration application contains
28     the required information indicating that the applicant is
29     legally qualified to register as stated in the application,
30     the commission shall mail to the applicant a voter's
1     identification card in accordance with subsection (d)(1).
2         (3)  For an application for a transfer of registration or
3     a change in address or name, if the application contains the
4     required information and the applicant is legally qualified
5     to transfer registration or change name or address as stated
6     in the application, the commission shall make the transfer or
7     change. If the commission suspects that the applicant is not
8     entitled to transfer registration or to change name or
9     address, the commission may investigate. If the commission
10     finds that the applicant is not entitled to the transfer or
11     change, the application shall be rejected. The applicant
12     shall be notified of the rejection and the reason for it.
13     Rejection shall be made no later than ten days before the
14     election succeeding the filing of the application.
15     (c)  Result.--If an application is designed to serve as a
16  registration card, the accepted application of an elector may
17  serve as the elector's official registration card, if it was so
18  designed, and shall be filed in the office of the commission in
19  accordance with Chapter 7. If the application is not designed to
20  serve as a registration card, the information contained on the
21  application, including the elector's signature, shall be
22  transferred to the registration card. If a commission utilizes a
23  signature digitization list, it shall transfer all information
24  contained on the application, including the signature, to the
25  registry or, until the registry is established, to a computer
26  file. Applicants for registration shall be challenged under
27  section 529.
28     (d)  Disposition.--
29         (1)  When the registration of an elector has been
30     processed under subsection (b)(2), the commission shall
1     transmit to the applicant by first class nonforwardable mail
2     a wallet-sized voter's identification card, which shall serve
3     as notice to the applicant of the disposition of the
4     application. The card shall contain all of the following:
5             (i)  Name and address of the elector.
6             (ii)  Name of municipality.
7             (iii)  Identification of elector's ward and district.
8             (iv)  Effective date of registration.

6  original registration cards shall be placed in exact
7  alphabetical order by last name of the registrant, shall be

23  registration cards shall be placed in exact alphabetical order
24  by last name of the registrant, indexed and kept at the office
25  of the commission in a manner as to be properly safeguarded.
26  These original cards constitute the general register of the
27  county. They may not be removed from the office of the
28  commission except upon order of a court of record. The
29  commission shall safely retain all registration cards used in
30  the registration of electors or in conducting an election. If a
1  commission has the capability to accept an electronic
2  application, the secretary may require the commission to produce
3  a computer-generated card to file in the general register. If
4  the commission finds a record for a registrant on the computer
5  data base which is not contained in the general register, it

25     (a)  Registration card file.--
26         (1)  Except as provided in subsection (b) and in section

29     last name of the registrant and shall be indexed.
30         (2)  The cards constitute the district register.
1         (3)  The commission shall provide binders, which are

10         (1)  [Instead] Before a commission is connected to the
11     SURE system, instead of using registration cards as the
12     district register as provided in subsection (a), a commission
13     may use a computer list or computer-generated cards
14     containing the registered electors arranged by election
15     district, alphabetically by last name of the registrant.
16         [(2)]  The computer list or computer-generated cards must
17     be in a form prescribed by the secretary and must contain
18     necessary information that would otherwise be available on
19     the registration cards, including a legible digitized
20     signature of the registrant copied from the signature on the
21     registration card. The district election officials shall have
22     computer printouts at the polling places containing the
23     necessary information needed to verify the identity of the
24     elector. The digitized signature list shall be open to public
25     inspection, subject to reasonable safeguards, rules and
26     regulations.
27         (2.1)  After a commission is connected to the SURE
28     system, each commission shall create from its general
29     register a computer list to be used as the district register.
30     For each election district, the list shall contain the names
1     of the registered electors of the election district,
2     alphabetically by last name of each registered elector. Each
3     page of the list shall contain the name of the county, the
4     election district, the date of the election and the date and
5     time the list was prepared. The computer list shall be in a
6     form prescribed by the secretary and must contain necessary
7     information that would otherwise be available in the general
8     register, including a legible digitized or electronic
9     signature, the street address and political party of each
10     registered elector, and suitable space for insertion of the
11     signature of the registered elector and for insertion by the
12     proper election official of the number and letter of the stub
13     of the ballot issued to the registered elector or the
14     registered elector's number in the order of admission to the
15     voting systems and the initials of the election official who

17         (1)  [The] Each commission shall establish a program to
18     identify registered electors whose address may have changed
19     by establishing one of the following programs:
20             (i)  National change of address. The secretary shall
21         establish by regulation a program whereby information
22         supplied by the United States Postal Service through its
23         licensees is used on a periodic basis, but not less than
24         once every calendar year, to identify registered electors
25         who may have changed addresses. The information shall be
26         incorporated in the SURE system and shall be forwarded to
27         the commissions in a manner determined by the secretary
28         by regulation.
29                 (A)  If it appears from the information provided
30             through the United States Postal Service that an
1             elector has moved to a different residence address
2             within the same county as the elector is currently
3             registered, the commission shall change the
4             registration records to show the new address and
5             shall send the elector, to the address recorded on
6             the elector's registration, a notice of the change of
7             address by forwardable mail and a postage prepaid,
8             preaddressed return form by which the elector may
9             verify or correct the address information.
10                 (B)  If it appears from the information provided
11             through the United States Postal Service that [an] a
12             registered elector has moved to a different residence
13             address outside the county, the commission shall use
14             the notice procedure described in clause (A).
15             (ii)  Confirmation mailing:
16                 (A)  A commission may establish a program by
17             sending a direct, nonforwardable first class "return
18             if undeliverable - address correction requested"
19             mailing to all registered electors in the county.
20                 (B)  If this program is established, the
21             commission shall use the notice procedure described
22             in subparagraph (i)(A) for any registered elector
23             whose mailing is returned undeliverable.
24         (2)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
25     program established under paragraph (1), a commission may use
26     a canvass [may be used] as follows:
27             (i)  The [registration] commission may, by
28         commissioners or by inspectors of registration, verify
29         the registration in an election district by visiting the
30         building from which an elector is registered and other
1         buildings as the commission deems necessary.
2             (ii)  The commission shall make a record of the name
3         and address of each registered elector who is found not
4         to reside at the registered address or who for any other
5         reason appears to be not qualified to vote in the
6         registered election district.
7             (iii)  The commission shall leave at the address of
8         each [person] registered elector referred to in
9         subparagraph (ii) a notice requiring him to communicate
10         with the commission on or before a date which the
11         commission shall designate, and which shall be not less
12         than seven days and not more than 15 days from the date
13         of the notice and in any case not later than the 15th day
14         preceding the election next ensuing, and satisfy the
15         commission of his qualifications as an elector. The
16         commission shall cause a confirmation of each such notice
17         to be sent by mail promptly to [such person] the
18         registered elector at the address from which he is
19         registered. The envelope containing such information is
20         to be plainly marked that it is not to be forwarded. At
21         the expiration of the time specified in the notice, the
22         commission shall cancel the registration of [such person]
23         the registered elector who has not communicated with the
24         commission and proved his qualifications as [an] a
25         registered elector.
26             (iv)  To facilitate the canvass under this section,
27         [the] a commission may, when necessary, appoint special
28         inspectors of registration, in number not exceeding
29         double the number of election districts being canvassed.
30             (v)  Special inspectors must be [qualified]
1         registered electors of the county. They shall be
2         appointed without reference to residence in election
3         districts or to political affiliations or beliefs. The
4         commission shall instruct special inspectors in their
5         duties. Special inspectors have the powers conferred by
6         this act upon inspectors of registration.
7         (3)  In conjunction with and not as an alternative to a
8     program established under paragraph (1), [the] a commission
9     shall send a notice pursuant to subsection (d) to any
10     registered elector who has not voted nor appeared to vote
11     during the period beginning five years before the date of the
12     notice and ending on the date of the notice and for whom the
13     board of elections did not during that period in any other
14     way receive any information that the [voter] elector still
15     resides in the [registered] election district.
16         (4)  [Commissions] A commission shall complete, not later
17     than 90 days before each [primary] municipal or general
18     election, at least once per year the voter removal programs
19     under this section and shall promptly update information
20     contained in its registration records. This paragraph shall
21     not be construed to preclude any of the following:
22             (i)  Cancellation of an elector's registration as
23         provided for under subsection (a)(1) or (2).
24             (ii)  Correction of registration records in
25         accordance with this act.
26     (c)  Identification of inactive [voters] electors.--A
27  commission shall mark an "I" on the registration [card] records
28  of each registered elector who has been mailed a form under
29  subsection (b)(1) or (3) and has failed to respond, which shall
30  be included with all other registration [cards] records for that
1  polling site and located at the [individual's] elector's polling
2  site on the day of the election. The commission shall promptly
3  update the information contained in its registration records.
4     (d)  Cancellation of registration.--
5         (1)  A commission shall not cancel the registration of
6     [an] a registered elector on the ground that the registered
7     elector has changed residence unless any of the following
8     apply:
9             (i)  The registered elector confirms in writing that
10         the elector has changed residence to a location outside
11         the county in which the elector is registered.
12             (ii)  The registered elector:
13                 (A)  has failed to respond to a notice described
14             in paragraph (2); and
15                 (B)  has not voted nor appeared to vote and, if
16             necessary, corrected the commission's record of the
17             elector's address, in an election during the period
18             beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the
19             day after the date of the second general election for
20             Federal office that occurs after the date of the
21             notice.
22         (2)  A notice, as required in paragraph (1)(ii), is
23     acceptable if it is a postage prepaid and preaddressed return
24     card, sent by forwardable mail, on which the registered
25     elector may state the elector's current address, if it
26     contains a notice as follows:
27             (i)  The notice must state all of the following:
28                 (A)  If the registered elector did not change
29             residence or changed residence but still resides in
30             the county, the elector must return the card not
1             later than 30 days prior to the next election. If the
2             card is not returned, affirmation or confirmation of
3             the elector's address may be required before the
4             elector is permitted to vote in an election during
5             the period beginning on the date of the notice and
6             ending on the day after the date of the second
7             general election for Federal office that occurs after
8             the date of the notice. If the elector does not vote
9             in an election during that period, the elector's
10             registration shall be canceled.
11                 (B)  If the registered elector has changed
12             residence to a place outside the county in which the
13             elector is registered, information shall be provided
14             concerning how the elector can register in the new
15             county of residence.
16             (ii)  The notice must state the date of the notice,
17         the date of the next election and the date of the second
18         general election for Federal office occurring after the
19         date of the notice.

22     conformance with this subsection. The commission shall also

1     date of an election, be permitted to vote in that polling

3     of address before an election official at that polling place.
4         (2)  [An] A registered elector who has moved from one

9     records and vote at the elector's former polling place upon
10     written affirmation by the elector of the new address before
11     an election official at the former polling place.
12     (b)  Different county.--[An] A registered elector who has

7     Section 18.  The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall
8  promulgate regulations to establish and implement the SURE
9  system in accordance with section 322 and to implement this act.
10  The promulgation of regulations under this section shall be
11  exempt from:
12         (1)  section 204(b) of the act of October 15, 1980
13     (P.L.950, No.164), known as the Commonwealth Attorneys Act;
14     and
15         (2)  the act of June 25, 1982 (P.L.633, No.181), known as
16     the Regulatory Review Act.
17     Section 19.  (1)  The provisions of 62 Pa.C.S. shall apply to
18     the implementation of Ch. 3 Subch. B of the act except as
19     provided in this section.
20         (2)  If a bidder or offeror, a prospective bidder or
21     offeror or a prospective contractor is aggrieved in
22     connection with the solicitation or award of the contract, he
23     may protest to the head of the purchasing agency in writing.
24         (3)  If the protestant is a bidder or offeror or a
25     prospective contractor, the protest shall be filed with the
26     head of the purchasing agency within seven days after the
27     aggrieved bidder or offeror or prospective contractor knew or
28     should have known of the facts giving rise to the protest
29     except that in no event may a protest be filed later than
30     seven days after the date the contract was awarded. If the
1     protestant is a prospective bidder or offeror, a protest
2     shall be filed with the head of the purchasing agency prior
3     to the bid opening time or the proposal receipt date. If a
4     bidder or offeror, a prospective bidder or offeror, or a
5     prospective contractor fails to file a protest or files an
6     untimely protest, the bidder or offeror, the prospective
7     bidder or offeror, or the prospective contractor shall be
8     deemed to have waived its right to protest the solicitation
9     or award of the contract in any forum. Untimely filed
10     protests shall be disregarded by the purchasing agency.
11         (4)  A protest shall state all grounds upon which the
12     protestant asserts the solicitation or award of the contract
13     was improper. The protestant may submit with the protest any
14     documents or information it deems relevant to the protest.
15         (5)  Within 15 days of receipt of a protest, the
16     contracting officer may submit to the head of the purchasing
17     agency and the protestant a response to the protest,
18     including any documents or information he deems relevant to
19     the protest. The protestant may file a reply to the response
20     within ten days of the date of the response.
21         (6)  The head of the purchasing agency or his designee
22     shall review the protest and any response or reply and may
23     request and review such additional documents or information
24     he deems necessary to render a decision, and may, at his sole
25     discretion, conduct a hearing. The head of the purchasing
26     agency or his designee shall provide to the protestant and
27     the contracting officer a reasonable opportunity to review
28     and address any additional documents or information deemed
29     necessary by the head of the purchasing agency or his
30     designee to render a decision.
1         (7)  Upon completing an evaluation of the protest in
2     accordance with paragraph (6), the head of the purchasing
3     agency or his designee shall issue a written determination
4     stating the reasons for the decision. The determination shall
5     be issued within 60 days of the receipt of the protest unless
6     extended by consent of the head of the purchasing agency and
7     the protestant. The determination shall be the final order of
8     the purchasing agency. If the head of the purchasing agency
9     or his designee determines that the solicitation or award of
10     the contract was contrary to law, he may enter an order
11     authorized by 62 Pa.C.S. Ch. 17 Subch. D.
12         (8)  Within 15 days of the mailing date of a final
13     determination denying a protest, a protestant may file an
14     appeal with the Commonwealth Court. Issues not raised by the
15     protestant before the purchasing agency are deemed waived and
16     may not be raised before the court.
17         (9)  The record of determination for review by the court
18     shall consist of the solicitation or award; the contract, if
19     any; the protest and any response, reply or any additional
20     documents or information considered by the head of the
21     purchasing agency or his designee; the hearing transcript and
22     exhibits, if any; and the final determination.
23         (10)  The court shall hear the appeal, without a jury, on
24     the record of determination certified by the purchasing
25     agency. The court shall affirm the determination of the
26     purchasing agency unless it finds from the record that the
27     determination is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of
28     discretion or is contrary to law.
29         (11)  If the determination is not affirmed, the court may
30     enter any order authorized by 42 Pa.C.S. § 706, provided,
1     that if the court determines that the solicitation or award
2     of the contract is contrary to law, then the remedy the court
3     shall order is limited to canceling the solicitation or award
4     and declaring void any resulting contract.
5         (12)  In the event a protest is filed timely under this
6     section and until the time has elapsed for the protestant to
7     file a petition for review in Commonwealth Court, the
8     purchasing agency may elect not to proceed further with the
9     solicitation or with the award of the contract.
10         (13)  This section shall be the exclusive procedure for
11     protesting a solicitation or award of the contract by a
12     bidder or offeror, a prospective bidder or offeror, or a
13     prospective contractor that is aggrieved in connection with
14     the solicitation or award of the contract. The provisions of
15     2 Pa.C.S. shall not apply to this section.
16     Section 20.  Section 18 shall expire on December 31, 2002.
17     Section 21.  This act shall take effect as follows:
18         (1)  This section and sections 4, 18 and 19 of this act
19     shall take effect immediately.
