2  read:
3     Section 976.  Examination of Nomination Petitions,
4  Certificates and Papers; Return of Rejected Nomination
5  Petitions, Certificates and Papers.--When any nomination
6  petition, nomination certificate or nomination paper is
7  presented in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth or
8  of any county board of elections for filing within the period
9  limited by this act, it shall be the duty of the said officer or
10  board to examine the same. No nomination petition, nomination
11  paper or nomination certificate shall be permitted to be filed
12  if--(a) it contains material errors or defects apparent on the
13  face thereof, or on the face of the appended or accompanying
14  affidavits; or (b) it contains material alterations made after
15  signing without the consent of the signers; or (c) it does not
16  contain a sufficient number of signatures as required by law;
17  Provided, however, That the Secretary of the Commonwealth or the
18  county board of elections, although not hereby required so to
19  do, may question the genuineness of any signature or signatures
20  appearing thereon, and if he or it shall thereupon find that any
21  such signature or signatures are not genuine, such signature or
22  signatures shall be disregarded in determining whether the
23  nomination petition, nomination paper or nomination certificate
24  contains a sufficient number of signatures as required by law;
25  or (d) in the case of nomination petitions, if nomination
26  petitions have been filed for printing the name of the same
27  person for the same office[, except the office of judge of a
28  court of common pleas, the Philadelphia Municipal Court or the
29  Traffic Court of Philadelphia, or the office of school director
30  in districts where that office is elective or the office of
1  justice of the peace] upon the official ballot of more than one
2  political party; or (e) in the case of nomination papers, if the
3  candidate named therein has filed a nomination petition for any
4  public office for the ensuing primary, or has been nominated for
5  any such office by nomination papers previously filed; or (f) if
6  the nomination petitions or papers are not accompanied by the
7  filing fee or certified check required for said office; or (g)
8  in the case of nomination papers, the appellation set forth
9  therein is identical with or deceptively similar to the words
10  used by any existing party or by any political body which has
11  already filed nomination papers for the same office, or if the
12  appellation set forth therein contains part of the name, or an
13  abbreviation of the name or part of the name of an existing
14  political party, or of a political body which has already filed
15  nomination papers for the same office. The invalidity of any
16  sheet of a nomination petition or nomination paper shall not
17  affect the validity of such petition or paper if a sufficient
18  petition or paper remains after eliminating such invalid sheet.
19  The action of said officer or board in refusing to receive and
20  file any such nomination petition, certificate or paper, may be
21  reviewed by the court upon an application to compel its
22  reception as of the date when it was presented to the office of
23  such officer or board: Provided, however, That said officer or
24  board shall be entitled to a reasonable time in which to examine
25  any petitions, certificates or papers, and to summon and
26  interrogate the candidates named therein, or the persons
27  presenting said petitions, certificates or papers, and his or
28  their retention of same for the purpose of making such
29  examination or interrogation shall not be construed as an
30  acceptance or filing.
1     Upon completion of any examination, if any nomination
2  petition, certificate or paper is found to be defective, it
3  shall forthwith be rejected and returned to the candidate or one
4  of the candidates named therein, together with a statement of
5  the reasons for such rejection:
6     Provided further, That no nomination petition, nomination
7  paper or nomination certificate shall be permitted to be filed,
8  if the political party or political body referred to therein
9  shall be composed of a group of electors whose purposes or aims,
10  or one of whose purposes or aims, is the establishment, control,
11  conduct, seizure or overthrow of the Government of the
12  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States of America by
13  the use of force, violence, military measure or threats of one
14  or more of the foregoing. The authority to reject such
15  nomination petition, paper or certificate for this reason shall,
16  when filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth, be vested in
17  a committee composed of the Governor, the Attorney General and
18  the Secretary of the Commonwealth, and when filed with any
19  county board of elections shall be vested in such board. If in
20  such case the committee or board, as the case may be, shall
21  conclude that the acceptance of such nomination petition, paper
22  or certificate should be refused, it shall within two days of
23  the filing of such nomination petition, paper or certificate fix
24  a place and a time five days in advance for hearing the matter,
25  and notice thereof shall be given to all parties affected
26  thereby. At the time and place so fixed the committee or board,
27  as the case may be, shall hear testimony, but shall not be bound
28  by technical rules of evidence. The testimony presented shall be
29  stenographically recorded and made a part of the record of the
30  committee or board. Within two days after such hearing the
1  committee or board, if satisfied upon competent evidence that
2  the said nomination petition, paper or certificate is not
3  entitled to be accepted and filed, it shall announce its
4  decision and immediately notify the parties affected thereby.
5  Failure to announce decision within two days after such hearing
6  shall be conclusive that such nomination petition, paper or
7  certificate has been accepted and filed. The decision of said
8  committee or board in refusing to accept and file such
9  nomination petition, paper or certificate may be reviewed by the
10  court upon an application to compel its reception as of the date
11  when presented to the Secretary of the Commonwealth or such
12  board. The application shall be made within two days of the time
13  when such decision is announced. If the application is properly
14  made, any judge of said court may fix a time and place for
15  hearing the matter in dispute, of which notice shall be served
16  with a copy of said application upon the Secretary of the
17  Commonwealth or the county board of elections, as the case may
18  be. At the time so fixed, the court, or any judge thereof
19  assigned for the purpose, shall hear the case de novo. If after
20  such hearing the said court shall find that the decision of the
21  committee or the board was erroneous, it shall issue its mandate
22  to the committee or board to correct its decision and to accept
23  and file the nomination paper, petition or certificate. From any
24  decision of the court an appeal may be taken within two days
25  after the entry thereof. It shall be the duty of the said court
26  to fix the hearing and to announce its decision within such
27  period of time as will permit the Secretary of the Commonwealth
28  or the county board of elections to permit the names of the
29  candidates affected by the court's decision to be printed on the
30  ballot, if the court should so determine.

8  ballot by a diagonal perforated line so prepared that the upper
9  right hand corner of the back of the ballot containing the
10  number may be detached from the ballot before it is deposited in
11  the ballot box and beside that corner shall also be printed,
12  "Remove numbered stub immediately before depositing your ballot
13  in ballot box."
14     Section 7.  This act shall take effect immediately.
