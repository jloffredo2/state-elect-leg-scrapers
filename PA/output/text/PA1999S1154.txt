29  purchase, after due notice in one newspaper of general
30  circulation, published or circulating in the county, at least
1  [three] TWO times at intervals of not less than three days where  <--

12  commissioners, in sealed envelopes[, and shall be opened in the
13  presence of the controller, or chief clerk as the case may be,
14  by the commissioners and the contract awarded thereon]. Bids
15  shall be opened publicly at a time and place specified in the

11  at a subsequent meeting, the time and place of which shall be
12  publicly announced when bids are so opened. If for any reason
13  the award is not made at either of the above meetings, the same
14  business may be transacted at any subsequent meeting, the time
15  and place of which shall have been announced at the previous
16  meeting held for such award. [At such third meeting, the
17  commissioners shall either award the contract or shall reject
18  all bids.] The contract shall be awarded, or all bids shall be
19  rejected, within thirty days of the opening of the bids, except
20  for bids subject to 62 Pa.C.S. (relating to procurement).
21  Thirty-day extensions of the date for the award may be made by
22  the mutual written consent of the commissioners and any bidder
23  who wishes to remain under consideration for award. The
24  commissioners shall excuse from consideration any bidder not
25  wishing to agree to a request for extension of the date for the
26  award and shall release such bidder from any bid bond or similar
27  bid security furnished under subsection (f). All contracts shall
28  be filed with the controller, or with the chief clerk as the
29  case may be, immediately after their execution.
30     (f)  [All bids advertised for shall be accompanied by cash,
1  by a certified good faith check or by a cashier's check drawn
2  upon a bank authorized to do business in this Commonwealth, in

11  bond with corporate surety in a reasonable amount. Whenever it
12  is required that a bid be accompanied by cash, certified check,
13  cashier's check, bank good faith check or other irrevocable
14  letter of credit or bond, no bid shall be considered unless so
15  accompanied. In the event any bidder shall, upon award of the
16  contract to him, fail to comply with the requirements
17  hereinafter stated as to [a bond] security guaranteeing the
18  performance of the contract, the [good faith deposit by cash,
19  certified check, cashier's check or bond] security furnished
20  under this subsection shall be forfeited to the county as
21  liquidated damages.
22     (g)  [The] For contracts which involve the furnishing of       <--
23  labor and materials such as construction contracts, the
24  successful bidder, when [advertising] a formal bid is required

30  has been awarded, unless the commissioners shall prescribe a

12  shall be void. [The above mandatory provisions of this
13  subsection shall not apply to contracts for the purchase of
14  motor vehicles or other pieces of equipment but shall apply only
15  to contracts which involve the furnishing of labor and

9     Section 2611.  Authorization to Contract with [City or
10  Borough] Municipality for Sharing of Certain Costs.--When any
11  bridge is proposed to be located in any [city or borough]

13  [city or borough] municipality providing that the [city or
14  borough] municipality shall bear a portion of the cost of the

16  such bridge or that the [city or borough] municipality shall
17  provide or maintain the approach thereto within the [city or
18  borough] municipality or bear the costs of property damages of
19  said approach. Every such agreement shall be entered into in
20  writing and at least one executed copy thereof shall be

25  authorized for use in the maintenance of county bridges.
26     Section 2631.  Providing and Maintaining Dykes, Banks,

12     [Section 2637.  Repair of Bridges, Viaducts and Subways When
13  Liability for Such Repairs is in Doubt.--Whenever any bridge,
14  viaduct or subway carrying a public highway over or under a
15  railroad, street railway or other highway in any county is out
16  of repair, and an application has been made to the Public
17  Utility Commission to compel the repair thereof from which
18  proceedings it appears that there is a contest between or among
19  political subdivisions or between or among political
20  subdivisions and public utilities as to the liability for such
21  repair, and that the cost thereof is not in dispute, the
22  petitioner or petitioners or any other person or corporation
23  interested may forthwith apply to the commissioners of the
24  county for the prompt repair thereof.
25     Such application shall be made by serving, upon the county
26  commissioners, a certified copy of the petition and each of the
27  answers on file before the Public Utility Commission. After such
28  service, the county commissioners may take such steps as may be
29  necessary to repair the bridge, viaduct or subway and make it
30  safe for public travel.
1     Section 2638.  Contributions Towards Work.--Should the county
2  commissioners find it impracticable to make any or all such
3  repairs with county funds, they shall so notify the complainant
4  in the proceedings instituted before the Public Utility
5  Commission. Thereupon, any persons, including the county
6  interested in having such repairs made, may contribute to a fund
7  to be deposited with the county treasurer for the purpose of
8  making said repairs. When the fund becomes sufficient for said
9  purpose, the commissioners shall take the necessary steps to
10  place said bridge, viaduct or subway in repair and safe for
11  public travel. The repairs may be made partly from such
12  contributions and partly from public funds, if the commissioners
13  find it expedient so to do.
14     Section 2639.  Collection of Costs of Repairs; Return of
15  Contributions.--The cost of such repairs shall be kept by the
16  commissioners in an open account until there has been a final
17  adjudication of the proceedings before the Public Utility
18  Commission, whereupon the amount so expended, together with ten
19  per centum of said amount to cover the cost of supervision of
20  the work, shall be collected as awards of the Public Utility
21  Commission are collected, and shall be paid into the county
22  treasury. Thereupon, any contributions which may have been made
23  under the provisions of the section immediately preceding shall
24  be returned to the respective contributors.]

27     Section 2650.  Procedure for Taking Over Bridge by County;
28  Aid to Political Subdivisions in Construction and Maintenance of
29  Bridge.--(a)  Whenever the construction of any new bridge, or of
30  any bridge to replace any existing bridge, over a stream, or
1  over or under a railroad, and forming part of any road in any
2  city, borough, town or township, or between any two or more such
3  political subdivisions is necessary, and requires more expense
4  than it is reasonable that such political subdivision, or any
5  two of them jointly, should bear, and if it shall appear to the
6  commissioners of the county that such bridge is necessary, and
7  would be too expensive for such political subdivision or
8  adjoining political subdivisions to bear, it may, at the
9  discretion of the county commissioners, be entered on record as
10  a county bridge. Such bridge shall thereupon be erected,
11  maintained and kept in repair in the same manner as other county
12  bridges constructed under the provisions of subdivision (a) of
13  this article.
14     (b)  If the county commissioners refuse to have such bridge
15  entered on record as a county bridge, the county may pay the
16  entire cost or any part of the cost of constructing such bridge
17  including damages. Such bridge shall thereupon be a municipal or
18  township bridge to be maintained and kept in repair by such
19  political subdivision. The county commissioners may, at their
20  discretion, furnish such political subdivision the whole or any
21  part of the money necessary to maintain such municipal or
22  township bridge.
23     (c)  Where the cost to the county will not exceed [one
24  thousand five hundred dollars ($1500)] ten thousand dollars
25  ($10,000), the county commissioners may furnish such aid in the
26  construction of such bridge without following the procedure
27  herein stipulated.
28     Section 2653.  Contract for Parts of Municipal Bridges Where
29  County Might Have Built Bridge.--(a)  Where a city of the third
30  class, a borough or a township [of the first class] is
1  authorized to construct a bridge or viaduct over a stream or
2  other place over which the county is authorized to build bridges
3  and such political subdivision is authorized to contract with
4  the county and with railroads, street railways and other
5  companies or parties interested for the building and maintenance
6  of such bridge or viaduct and for the payment of any damages
7  caused by the location or building thereof, the county
8  commissioners may contract with such city, borough or township
9  for that part or portion of the bridge which crosses any of the
10  places hereinbefore mentioned, including the abutments and piers
11  thereof. Such part shall thereafter be maintained as a county
12  bridge.
13     (b)  In lieu of the contract above provided for, the county
14  commissioners may contract for any part or portion of the whole
15  structure equal to or greater than the part or portion which the
16  county might have built.
17     (c)  The contracts provided for in this section may stipulate
18  that the county shall pay a certain portion of the whole
19  contract price or cost of the work, including damages, or may
20  stipulate that the county shall construct or pay for the
21  construction of a certain part of the work, and may otherwise
22  provide for the payment of the damages. The amount to be paid by
23  the county shall be paid directly to the contractor as may be
24  provided by the contract.
25     Section 2654.  Joining With [City] Municipality in Another
26  County in Building or Rebuilding Bridge.--When any bridge or
27  proposed bridge is on the dividing line between two counties
28  which is also the dividing line between one county and a [city]
29  municipality in the other county and such [city] municipality
30  has authority to build or rebuild such bridge or to join with
1  any county therein, said county may join with said [city]
2  municipality in the other county in building or rebuilding such
3  bridge. The cost of such bridge shall be paid in such
4  proportions as shall be agreed upon by the county and [city]
5  municipality so joining.

7     Section 2655.  Aiding [City] Municipality in Constructing
8  Bridge Over Ravine or Valley.--Whenever different parts of any
9  [city or any part of such city and any township bordering
10  thereon] municipality or any two municipalities are separated by
11  an intervening valley or ravine, and the commissioners of the
12  county in which such [city is] municipality or municipalities
13  are located shall decide it necessary that a public bridge, to
14  connect the territories thus separated, be constructed [and that
15  such bridge will be of substantial advantage and benefit to the
16  people of the township bordering thereon or townships adjacent
17  thereto], such county may contract with such [city] municipality
18  or municipalities for the laying out and construction of such
19  bridge by such [city] municipality or municipalities, and may
20  pay to the [city] municipality or municipalities such portion of
21  the cost thereof as the county commissioners shall deem
22  reasonable.

28  municipality, or both, or by any two [boroughs or two townships,
29  or any of them] municipalities, and it shall afterwards appear
30  to the commissioners that the care, maintenance and
1  responsibility of said bridge is greater than it is reasonable
2  that the said political subdivisions should bear, the
3  commissioners may enter such bridge upon record as a county
4  bridge, and it shall thereafter be a county bridge in the same
5  manner as if it had originally been so entered on record, if the
6  proper local authorities having the maintenance, supervision and
7  control of such bridge shall tender the same to the said county
8  commissioners free and without charge.

11     [Section 2657.  Acquisition of Toll Bridges by Purchase or
12  Condemnation.--(a)  The county may purchase or acquire any toll
13  bridge situated within the county which is necessary for the
14  accommodation of public travel and on which the payment of tolls
15  is burdensome to the traveling public, together with the
16  approaches and appurtenances thereto as herein provided.
17     (c)  The commissioners of the county may purchase the bridge
18  with the approaches and appurtenances thereto, at a price to be
19  agreed upon by the commissioners and the owner of the bridge,
20  or, upon failure to agree upon a purchase price, the county
21  commissioners may take the bridge under eminent domain or
22  condemnation proceedings as provided by law. Thereafter, the
23  bridge shall be entered on record as a county bridge, and shall
24  be controlled, maintained and used as a public bridge.
25     (d)  Such bridge may be freed from tolls at any time
26  thereafter, but in no event later than the time when all debt
27  incurred as a result of the acquisition thereof is extinguished.
28  The county shall at all times have authority to charge tolls or
29  rentals for the use thereof from railway, telephone and
30  telegraph companies and other persons or companies using such
1  bridge for other than ordinary public foot and vehicular travel.
2  Where contracts exist between such persons or companies and the
3  owners of such bridge, such contract shall be preserved for the
4  benefit of the county and shall be assigned thereto.
5     Section 2658.  Contracts with Municipalities for Purchase or
6  Condemnation of Toll Bridges.--Where a political subdivision may
7  purchase, condemn and maintain any toll bridge crossing any
8  stream within its limits and may enter into contracts with the
9  county commissioners whereby the county shall pay a portion of
10  the costs thereof, the county commissioners may enter into such
11  contract upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon
12  for the purchase, appropriation or condemnation of such bridge.
13  The contract may stipulate that the political subdivision and
14  the county shall each pay a certain portion of the purchase
15  price and of the damages allowed by any condemnation
16  proceedings, and may also provide for the maintenance and repair
17  of such bridge. The amount to be paid by the county shall be
18  paid into the treasury of such subdivision, and shall be applied
19  solely to the payment for such bridge.
20     Section 2659.  Leasing of Toll Bridges or of Right to Use
21  Same.--(a)  Whenever a toll bridge owned or maintained by a
22  bridge company organized and existing under the laws of this
23  Commonwealth shall span a stream in this Commonwealth, and such
24  bridge or any portion thereof is used solely by the public for
25  general highway purposes, or by the public for such purposes
26  concurrently with the use of the same by any railroad company or
27  street railway company engaged as a common carrier, and the
28  commissioners of the county in which such bridge is located
29  shall by resolution declare such bridge or any portion thereof
30  necessary for the accommodation of the public for general
1  highway purposes, and that the payment of tolls on such bridge
2  is burdensome to the public using the same for such purposes,
3  then the county shall have the power to enter into a contract
4  with the bridge company whereby the company may lease to the
5  county such bridge, or such portion thereof as may be used by
6  the public for general highway purposes for the use of the same
7  by the public for said purposes, free from the payment of tolls.
8  Such contract may provide for the payment by the county of such
9  rental for such definite term of years not to exceed twenty and
10  for such other terms and conditions as may be agreed upon and as
11  the commissioners shall deem reasonable and proper.

13  such bridge company or corporation providing for the use, during
14  a definite period, not exceeding twenty years, of such bridge or
15  any portion thereof by the public for general highway purposes,
16  free from the payment of tolls during the term of such contract,
17  subject to the concurrent use of such bridge, or any portion
18  thereof, by any railroad company or street railway company
19  engaged as a common carrier and making use of such bridge, or
20  any portion thereof. Such lease shall contain such terms of
21  payment for such use by the public of the bridge or any portion
22  thereof, and such other terms, provisions and conditions as may
23  be agreed upon, and as the county commissioners shall deem
24  reasonable and proper. No tolls shall be charged the public for
25  the use of said bridge or any portion thereof for general
26  highway purposes during the term of any such lease or any such

1  Counties.--Whenever it is necessary for any counties, in the
2  construction of any joint county bridge, or in the joint
3  acquisition of any toll bridge, to issue bonds in payment of
4  such construction or acquisition, including the approaches
5  thereto, of the damages sustained by owners of lands taken in
6  the construction or acquisition thereof, and including
7  reasonable fees for necessary legal services required in such
8  construction or acquisition, the county commissioners of said
9  county or counties may, with the consent of the State Department
10  of Highways if the cost of such bridge was in excess of four
11  hundred thousand dollars ($400,000), assess, supervise and

22  of such fine, then to imprisonment of not less than ten days, or
23  more than thirty days, in the county prison of either of said
24  counties.
25     (c)  Such powers and duties of said commissioners acting as a
26  joint commission shall continue until the redemption of the last
27  of said bonds to be redeemed by such tolls, whereupon said
28  bridge shall be turned over as a free bridge to the
29  Commonwealth, if such bridge crosses a river and is located on a
30  State highway route, or connects two State highway routes.
1  Thereafter, such bridge shall be maintained by the Highway
2  Department at the expense of the Commonwealth. Otherwise, such
3  bridge shall be maintained as other joint county bridges.]
